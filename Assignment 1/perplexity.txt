Stately , plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead , bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed . : 12390.10043319564
A yellow dressinggown , ungirdled , was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air . : 14789.073765203686
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: : 29966.245369425465
—_Introibo ad altare Dei_. : 70202.74128010684
Halted , he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: : 19617.893267687217
—Come up , Kinch ! : 44913.60089583389
Come up , you fearful jesuit ! : 44583.03289576081
Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest . : 18396.049452204075
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower , the surrounding land and the awaking mountains . : 12867.383447500864
Then , catching sight of Stephen Dedalus , he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air , gurgling in his throat and shaking his head . : 16094.577588110926
Stephen Dedalus , displeased and sleepy , leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him , equine in its length , and at the light untonsured hair , grained and hued like pale oak. : 10449.675733397162
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly. : 14251.199094111222
—Back to barracks ! : 70202.74128010684
he said sternly. : 391367.1449280334
He added in a preacher’s tone: : 61300.022631343956
—For this , O dearly beloved , is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns . : 14053.134742107508
Slow music , please . : 44918.121254250036
Shut your eyes , gents . : 33359.33649730309
One moment . : 1546149.7219643556
A little trouble about those white corpuscles . : 31658.464114038976
Silence , all. : 147721.71540071006
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points . : 10188.476600049484
Chrysostomos . : 654070.9864952827
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm. : 22995.502834871942
—Thanks , old chap , he cried briskly . : 20296.97135269506
That will do nicely . : 278645.41994313465
Switch off the current , will you ? : 28197.87000802069
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher , gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown . : 11459.27183476546
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages. A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips. : 11828.31495194244
—The mockery of it ! : 63851.40182905141
he said gaily . : 145783.73986078147
Your absurd name , an ancient Greek ! : 31655.404237280454
He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , laughing to himself . : 20256.381976238372
Stephen Dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck. : 13630.82338677684
Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on. : 33362.90043662681
—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan , two dactyls . : 16964.469588019227
But it has a Hellenic ring , hasn’t it ? : 38170.61669266146
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself . : 29827.968862041653
We must go to Athens . : 51070.794270267834
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ? : 42453.8134010489
He laid the brush aside and , laughing with delight , cried: : 16851.799334726937
—Will he come ? : 320948.3584827694
The jejune jesuit ! : 65933.15784360672
Ceasing , he began to shave with care. : 35673.07050253812
—Tell me , Mulligan , Stephen said quietly. : 22985.416740749177
—Yes , my love ? : 124860.35810324851
—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower ? : 16955.80277006715
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder. : 18398.414282864545
—God , isn’t he dreadful ? : 33362.90043662681
he said frankly . : 145783.73986078147
A ponderous Saxon . : 133030.74467174814
He thinks you’re not a gentleman . : 29951.49865207911
God , these bloody English ! : 33360.75158290701
Bursting with money and indigestion . : 33361.46803663681
Because he comes from Oxford . : 33360.03514451585
You know , Dedalus , you have the real Oxford manner . : 36359.325556592186
He can’t make you out . : 67829.10173577853
O , my name for you is the best: Kinch , the knife-blade. : 14945.553286749146
He shaved warily over his chin. : 37717.120518873475
—He was raving all night about a black panther , Stephen said . : 19632.003338373066
Where is his guncase ? : 90869.73952675381
—A woful lunatic ! : 70202.74128010684
Mulligan said . : 477931.78174938937
Were you in a funk ? : 54218.752195732784
—I was , Stephen said with energy and growing fear . : 16960.702436505326
Out here in the dark with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther . : 11289.053485226688
You saved men from drowning . : 41007.575941374074
I’m not a hero , however . : 26961.089752191478
If he stays on here I am off. : 34736.20692795467
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade . : 18379.68488627124
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily. : 15022.074658468306
—Scutter ! : 654070.9864952827
he cried thickly. : 391465.5197423517
He came over to the gunrest and , thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper pocket , said: : 20103.824959238198
—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor. : 16954.566890547896
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief . : 12050.210947150457
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. Then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said: : 13653.488705418507
—The bard’s noserag ! : 70202.74128010684
A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen. You can almost taste it , can’t you ? : 15607.825689703352
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly. : 12512.87758721054
—God ! : 654070.9864952827
he said quietly . : 145783.73986078147
Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother ? : 21260.414315952596
The snotgreen sea . : 65933.15784360672
The scrotumtightening sea . : 65933.15784360672
_Epi oinopa ponton_. Ah , Dedalus , the Greeks ! : 18369.680025033835
I must teach you . : 130478.03788927122
You must read them in the original . : 55583.29657648973
_Thalatta ! : 654070.9864952827
Thalatta ! : 654070.9864952827
_ She is our great sweet mother. Come and look. : 18394.891137384253
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet . : 26109.56801832642
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown. : 14035.991612144644
—Our mighty mother ! : 70202.74128010684
Buck Mulligan said. : 147721.71540071006
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s face. : 15833.643606095658
—The aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said . : 38845.1550109736
That’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you. : 21255.905329436606
—Someone killed her , Stephen said gloomily. : 26948.54063288176
—You could have knelt down , damn it , Kinch , when your dying mother asked you , Buck Mulligan said . : 13256.435731290447
I’m hyperborean as much as you . : 99120.80452322253
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her . : 20218.04848910394
And you refused . : 90566.4343382966
There is something sinister in you.... : 70190.32157430105
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek . : 18139.047829501913
A tolerant smile curled his lips. : 51089.199782858705
—But a lovely mummer ! : 44926.22294796299
he murmured to himself . : 203776.8265084264
Kinch , the loveliest mummer of them all ! : 57422.18140329683
He shaved evenly and with care , in silence , seriously. : 34377.1546808819
Stephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve. Pain , that was not yet the pain of love , fretted his heart . : 13562.119510147584
Silently , in a dream she had come to him after her death , her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , that had bent upon him , mute , reproachful , a faint odour of wetted ashes . : 10183.80473521961
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him . : 12214.95605211583
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid . : 14003.35198295724
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting. : 11479.096681968713
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade. : 33362.90043662681
—Ah , poor dogsbody ! : 44926.22294796299
he said in a kind voice . : 102709.54764580066
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags . : 40939.57602781594
How are the secondhand breeks ? : 63684.45057660439
—They fit well enough , Stephen answered. : 44610.21861267695
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip. : 22999.514245861126
—The mockery of it , he said contentedly . : 38375.34988515994
Secondleg they should be . : 151328.32513120887
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off . : 28112.38532905953
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe , grey . : 23190.474006896282
You’ll look spiffing in them . : 69662.9318312868
I’m not joking , Kinch . : 33362.18422894433
You look damn well when you’re dressed. : 32191.155464397867
—Thanks , Stephen said . : 90876.76306101568
I can’t wear them if they are grey. : 34537.17978909853
—He can’t wear them , Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror. Etiquette is etiquette . : 12718.686227404729
He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers. : 19800.879142898742
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin. : 14348.856817823218
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes. : 14775.366042505924
—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night , said Buck Mulligan , says you have g . : 19347.820006386522
p . : 654070.9864952827
i . : 654070.9864952827
He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General paralysis of the insane ! : 14937.893145759357
He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea . : 11453.673490461726
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth . : 15296.885644094215
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk. : 26961.52072013498
—Look at yourself , he said , you dreadful bard ! : 24728.34741988772
Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack . : 12625.30346552973
Hair on end . : 70200.4807089873
As he and others see me . : 71922.30223653652
Who chose this face for me ? : 76868.7293233433
This dogsbody to rid of vermin . : 33016.36427154714
It asks me too. : 75759.50523113993
—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room , Buck Mulligan said . : 26806.956766211955
It does her all right . : 63125.71085600227
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead him not into temptation . : 14003.35198295724
And her name is Ursula. : 55078.106330148345
Laughing again , he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes. : 21241.793370480544
—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror , he said . : 23257.337829991076
If Wilde were only alive to see you ! : 36843.01653055976
Drawing back and pointing , Stephen said with bitterness: : 20316.337674277045
—It is a symbol of Irish art . : 22983.382806906633
The cracked lookingglass of a servant. : 31946.256585796094
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them. : 11558.731748160055
—It’s not fair to tease you like that , Kinch , is it ? : 25130.501613914344
he said kindly. God knows you have more spirit than any of them. : 24569.510767102176
Parried again . : 278829.4303690811
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his . : 31896.136310661164
The cold steel pen. : 65933.15784360672
—Cracked lookingglass of a servant ! : 54221.81472797815
Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea . : 14230.112761779777
He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman . : 16958.957911536585
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other . : 15090.261797887308
God , Kinch , if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island. Hellenise it. : 16004.260119275248
Cranly’s arm . : 147721.71540071006
His arm. : 1088765.8849003161
—And to think of your having to beg from these swine . : 18146.724875298674
I’m the only one that knows what you are . : 68291.21055898385
Why don’t you trust me more ? : 36309.22806931511
What have you up your nose against me ? : 26932.95966854088
Is it Haines ? : 113075.91162792125
If he makes any noise here I’ll bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe. : 14758.999107730335
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms . : 26168.187787996834
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter , one clasping another . : 20227.799133720095
O , I shall expire ! : 36795.95883915183
Break the news to her gently , Aubrey ! : 20293.210489798323
I shall die ! : 65580.63717361505
With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table , with trousers down at heels , chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor’s shears . : 12061.117872998351
A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade . : 31660.490537917343
I don’t want to be debagged ! : 42749.22448984734
Don’t you play the giddy ox with me ! : 24354.852530150743
Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle . : 23297.38161270531
A deaf gardener , aproned , masked with Matthew Arnold’s face , pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms. : 11714.81540083211
To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos. : 58528.51815694611
—Let him stay , Stephen said . : 44612.682409470566
There’s nothing wrong with him except at night. : 22991.178456196452
—Then what is it ? : 53742.846313254
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently . : 44925.06562279552
Cough it up . : 169332.10134067535
I’m quite frank with you . : 72242.32629564748
What have you against me now ? : 31197.607392445352
They halted , looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale . : 14895.54515364169
Stephen freed his arm quietly. : 44926.22294796299
—Do you wish me to tell you ? : 56780.027411476985
he asked. : 2821620.7786225514
—Yes , what is it ? : 56716.003575646006
Buck Mulligan answered . : 145815.91832917568
I don’t remember anything. : 65668.05553403238
He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke . : 32594.645690898888
A light wind passed his brow , fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes. : 12694.830952684879
Stephen , depressed by his own voice , said: : 20298.982513093866
—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s death ? : 16397.939767240136
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: : 33362.90043662681
—What ? : 654070.9864952827
Where ? : 3806582.195480173
I can’t remember anything . : 42588.151364357596
I remember only ideas and sensations . : 42945.62510136222
Why ? : 1850884.7781121505
What happened in the name of God ? : 75632.58093093413
—You were making tea , Stephen said , and went across the landing to get more hot water . : 19907.257021735448
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom . : 32662.328026617786
She asked you who was in your room. : 35584.3003344055
—Yes ? : 654070.9864952827
Buck Mulligan said . : 169353.91770043052
What did I say ? : 80672.98431856191
I forget. : 572301.727620578
—You said , Stephen answered , _O , it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead._ : 13162.161858803893
A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’s cheek. : 20486.557347653703
—Did I say that ? : 44911.48600186221
he asked . : 391415.51316403976
Well ? : 2348973.520800131
What harm is that ? : 55085.38713253723
He shook his constraint from him nervously. : 49552.70674093611
—And what is death , he asked , your mother’s or yours or my own ? : 24523.23641395125
You saw only your mother die . : 32188.222401415787
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom . : 13428.497567008497
It’s a beastly thing and nothing else . : 35712.01702719242
It simply doesn’t matter . : 96584.83284231566
You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you . : 19036.868793321046
Why ? : 1850884.7781121505
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you , only it’s injected the wrong way . : 17570.678943650684
To me it’s all a mockery and beastly . : 23533.45166030696
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning . : 33486.502358100326
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt . : 14233.907392518691
Humour her till it’s over . : 33357.1692676112
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette’s . : 13326.346840404032
Absurd ! : 654070.9864952827
I suppose I did say it . : 29253.071381916172
I didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother. : 25458.1939214478
He had spoken himself into boldness . : 45491.417466996114
Stephen , shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly: : 15037.084190005706
—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother. : 18331.158033605006
—Of what then ? : 70202.74128010684
Buck Mulligan asked. : 147721.71540071006
—Of the offence to me , Stephen answered. : 27427.74272964636
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel. : 26961.15767341365
—O , an impossible person ! : 33357.16862137706
he exclaimed. : 2821620.7786225514
He walked off quickly round the parapet . : 25213.0912485528
Stephen stood at his post , gazing over the calm sea towards the headland . : 13658.975729695136
Sea and headland now grew dim . : 26974.43105546525
Pulses were beating in his eyes , veiling their sight , and he felt the fever of his cheeks. : 12378.460990745332
A voice within the tower called loudly: : 38860.44194101052
—Are you up there , Mulligan ? : 26968.49661048042
—I’m coming , Buck Mulligan answered. : 33360.03514451585
He turned towards Stephen and said: : 37715.500653550494
—Look at the sea . : 44863.39401199491
What does it care about offences ? : 31202.174192800987
Chuck Loyola , Kinch , and come on down . : 24485.793207183677
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers. : 31996.09689368749
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase , level with the roof: : 25709.3717458201
—Don’t mope over it all day , he said . : 32176.723527680915
I’m inconsequent . : 147721.71540071006
Give up the moody brooding. : 44908.850534629266
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: : 15743.717077852567
And no more turn aside and brood Upon love’s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars. : 13524.520278510307
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed . : 13153.70850233921
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened , spurned by lightshod hurrying feet . : 13163.760692136837
White breast of the dim sea . : 26856.252937708177
The twining stresses , two by two . : 34618.413631078736
A hand plucking the harpstrings , merging their twining chords . : 21403.760388273706
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide. : 22973.67681414735
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly , shadowing the bay in deeper green . : 14259.459785556783
It lay beneath him , a bowl of bitter waters . : 33059.84402889928
Fergus’ song: I sang it alone in the house , holding down the long dark chords. Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music . : 16892.24892170943
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside . : 32154.72666950245
She was crying in her wretched bed . : 44328.62078670266
For those words , Stephen: love’s bitter mystery. : 31656.449112657196
Where now ? : 477952.30475725327
Her secrets: old featherfans , tasselled dancecards , powdered with musk , a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer . : 12106.544888618195
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl . : 20557.793206885497
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: : 12023.366561418394
I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility. : 35703.02798480194
Phantasmal mirth , folded away: muskperfumed. : 33362.90043662681
And no more turn aside and brood. : 31191.350099660613
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys . : 23309.989179388584
Memories beset his brooding brain . : 33362.90043662681
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament . : 17142.23636620533
A cored apple , filled with brown sugar , roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening . : 18194.56138219796
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts. : 15865.143809418829
In a dream , silently , she had come to him , her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , bent over him with mute secret words , a faint odour of wetted ashes. : 11108.77289342528
Her glazing eyes , staring out of death , to shake and bend my soul . : 14457.052722642193
On me alone . : 272779.4247695184
The ghostcandle to light her agony . : 26024.401693245647
Ghostly light on the tortured face . : 44559.489629290394
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror , while all prayed on their knees . : 15114.559487293036
Her eyes on me to strike me down . : 24034.931700614696
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat._ : 16964.66823466252
Ghoul ! : 654070.9864952827
Chewer of corpses ! : 70202.74128010684
No , mother ! : 209308.36162780054
Let me be and let me live. : 147420.3932353122
—Kinch ahoy ! : 147721.71540071006
Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower . : 20314.882616822182
It came nearer up the staircase , calling again . : 32634.306285081842
Stephen , still trembling at his soul’s cry , heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words. : 12441.632855996533
—Dedalus , come down , like a good mosey . : 18391.10575977858
Breakfast is ready . : 70200.4807089873
Haines is apologising for waking us last night . : 30046.137595948454
It’s all right. : 147721.71540071006
—I’m coming , Stephen said , turning. : 26963.94062986787
—Do , for Jesus’ sake , Buck Mulligan said . : 26148.231894542165
For my sake and for all our sakes. : 76361.72765597049
His head disappeared and reappeared. : 55083.78261804185
—I told him your symbol of Irish art . : 20315.755826291683
He says it’s very clever . : 37718.74003642331
Touch him for a quid , will you ? : 24342.81540152481
A guinea , I mean. : 74800.5841848188
—I get paid this morning , Stephen said. : 35713.797998126734
—The school kip ? : 70202.74128010684
Buck Mulligan said . : 169353.91770043052
How much ? : 2126709.016197176
Four quid ? : 477952.30475725327
Lend us one. : 147721.71540071006
—If you want it , Stephen said. : 26945.28224963768
—Four shining sovereigns , Buck Mulligan cried with delight . : 35053.98118504208
We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids . : 16961.31760868126
Four omnipotent sovereigns. : 477952.30475725327
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs , singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: : 12209.296097927776
O , won’t we have a merry time , Drinking whisky , beer and wine ! : 13158.524363346023
On coronation , Coronation day ! : 82469.09261352688
O , won’t we have a merry time On coronation day ! : 21258.09906950952
Warm sunshine merrying over the sea . : 26969.47755391415
The nickel shavingbowl shone , forgotten , on the parapet . : 19014.29542650925
Why should I bring it down ? : 36307.24027535148
Or leave it there all day , forgotten friendship ? : 18393.254463968555
He went over to it , held it in his hands awhile , feeling its coolness , smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes . : 10762.095616702572
I am another now and yet the same . : 44393.06290658936
A servant too . : 133013.6075034814
A server of a servant. : 74776.62088165256
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth , hiding and revealing its yellow glow . : 12996.215153720881
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated , turning. : 10367.88813358516
—We’ll be choked , Buck Mulligan said . : 35722.28673913047
Haines , open that door , will you ? : 24350.66040799522
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker . : 22973.306927961647
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting , went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors. : 19336.02072481204
—Have you the key ? : 44918.11916617765
a voice asked. : 147696.34304491166
—Dedalus has it , Buck Mulligan said . : 35689.082478538876
Janey Mack , I’m choked ! : 33362.90043662681
He howled , without looking up from the fire: : 22014.26307644713
—Kinch ! : 654070.9864952827
—It’s in the lock , Stephen said , coming forward. : 18352.474004688895
The key scraped round harshly twice and , when the heavy door had been set ajar , welcome light and bright air entered . : 13464.882929426074
Haines stood at the doorway , looking out . : 44404.313353834405
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait . : 20118.15798394845
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him . : 17540.455643819
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table , set them down heavily and sighed with relief. : 17096.650877785924
—I’m melting , he said , as the candle remarked when... But , hush ! : 25019.847982641357
Not a word more on that subject ! : 65739.294550017
Kinch , wake up ! : 44926.22294796299
Bread , butter , honey. Haines , come in . : 18396.76095040827
The grub is ready . : 42725.63881297594
Bless us , O Lord , and these thy gifts . : 21994.970042877274
Where’s the sugar ? : 70202.74128010684
O , jay , there’s no milk. : 26974.43105546525
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker . : 13131.39312529179
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet. : 33100.5216126323
—What sort of a kip is this ? : 46258.90283662158
he said . : 1266210.5661733155
I told her to come after eight. : 70949.55199935439
—We can drink it black , Stephen said thirstily . : 18398.888279265087
There’s a lemon in the locker. : 33234.971540608836
—O , damn you and your Paris fads ! : 28111.982545460072
Buck Mulligan said . : 169353.91770043052
I want Sandycove milk. : 65659.80380721725
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: : 20291.08946434587
—That woman is coming up with the milk. : 22959.969356339727
—The blessings of God on you ! : 33020.60391197325
Buck Mulligan cried , jumping up from his chair . : 18394.643481584226
Sit down . : 147696.50124456148
Pour out the tea there . : 48862.355527572145
The sugar is in the bag . : 39383.95622671608
Here , I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs. : 26128.948229352307
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates , saying: : 13294.785265187618
—_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._ : 22999.514245861126
Haines sat down to pour out the tea. : 30611.97685720824
—I’m giving you two lumps each , he said . : 32187.3684195992
But , I say , Mulligan , you do make strong tea , don’t you ? : 14521.016944195151
Buck Mulligan , hewing thick slices from the loaf , said in an old woman’s wheedling voice: : 14795.245166514573
—When I makes tea I makes tea , as old mother Grogan said . : 18323.5402439019
And when I makes water I makes water. : 63004.11868409749
—By Jove , it is tea , Haines said. : 22155.180535837128
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: : 26971.94879546415
—_So I do , Mrs Cahill , _ says she . : 27242.865070533953
_Begob , ma’am , _ says Mrs Cahill , _God send you don’t make them in the one pot._ : 14040.81101949586
He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread , impaled on his knife. : 13300.412085323327
—That’s folk , he said very earnestly , for your book , Haines . : 19829.40659444879
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum . : 14541.335163251644
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind. : 15769.970054207468
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice , lifting his brows: : 14339.318679215743
—Can you recall , brother , is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads ? : 13379.719901353776
—I doubt it , said Stephen gravely. : 44563.77269304946
—Do you now ? : 70202.74128010684
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone . : 37658.06263645848
Your reasons , pray ? : 74912.77645668616
—I fancy , Stephen said as he ate , it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion . : 18899.761647749372
Mother Grogan was , one imagines , a kinswoman of Mary Ann. : 15844.219518872262
Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight. : 33362.90043662681
—Charming ! : 654070.9864952827
he said in a finical sweet voice , showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly . : 17110.564612153357
Do you think she was ? : 117359.96974157584
Quite charming ! : 391499.13836868654
Then , suddenly overclouding all his features , he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: : 15067.480884264209
_—For old Mary Ann : 70202.74128010684
She doesn’t care a damn. : 44729.21603599022
But , hising up her petticoats..._ : 33099.23858841651
He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned. : 19804.41484599357
The doorway was darkened by an entering form. : 22287.717361958177
—The milk , sir ! : 44923.965433553545
—Come in , ma’am , Mulligan said . : 35717.12246049525
Kinch , get the jug. : 44923.93718745989
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow. : 18397.94032920243
—That’s a lovely morning , sir , she said . : 44311.970446209125
Glory be to God. : 70184.65059309546
—To whom ? : 147721.71540071006
Mulligan said , glancing at her . : 70859.797722871
Ah , to be sure ! : 149818.50017672835
Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker. : 18378.00258013805
—The islanders , Mulligan said to Haines casually , speak frequently of the collector of prepuces. : 13138.291596647037
—How much , sir ? : 118437.17619968149
asked the old woman. : 70193.69885001703
—A quart , Stephen said. : 44926.22294796299
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk , not hers . : 18145.31128224167
Old shrunken paps . : 70202.74128010684
She poured again a measureful and a tilly . : 20260.11921214308
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world , maybe a messenger . : 13651.058916294465
She praised the goodness of the milk , pouring it out. Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field , a witch on her toadstool , her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs . : 9505.30781697786
They lowed about her whom they knew , dewsilky cattle . : 17597.168432270235
Silk of the kine and poor old woman , names given her in old times . : 13136.497342835693
A wandering crone , lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer , their common cuckquean , a messenger from the secret morning . : 12593.912324520032
To serve or to upbraid , whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour. : 17736.092251468363
—It is indeed , ma’am , Buck Mulligan said , pouring milk into their cups. : 13658.971691112389
—Taste it , sir , she said. : 44484.26361596848
He drank at her bidding. : 52021.82265725438
—If we could live on good food like that , he said to her somewhat loudly , we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts . : 13467.71534328684
Living in a bogswamp , eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust , horsedung and consumptives’ spits. : 12038.43556501812
—Are you a medical student , sir ? : 42154.38157476079
the old woman asked. : 133022.176915529
—I am , ma’am , Buck Mulligan answered. : 22996.550659151864
—Look at that now , she said. : 44523.466993671536
Stephen listened in scornful silence . : 54306.40854992875
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly , her bonesetter , her medicineman: me she slights . : 12920.38528192307
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins , of man’s flesh made not in God’s likeness , the serpent’s prey . : 12330.187082720662
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes. : 14601.677250110763
—Do you understand what he says ? : 40946.87439583899
Stephen asked her. : 147721.71540071006
—Is it French you are talking , sir ? : 51464.005180146065
the old woman said to Haines. : 51079.38113313444
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech , confidently. : 37173.43839817315
—Irish , Buck Mulligan said . : 60010.13227348695
Is there Gaelic on you ? : 108233.51831788204
—I thought it was Irish , she said , by the sound of it . : 26799.05531429396
Are you from the west , sir ? : 129728.10056611877
—I am an Englishman , Haines answered. : 26974.43105546525
—He’s English , Buck Mulligan said , and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland. : 15273.625737571145
—Sure we ought to , the old woman said , and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the language myself . : 15887.678226498268
I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows. : 18396.992092111483
—Grand is no name for it , said Buck Mulligan . : 28744.395928866492
Wonderful entirely . : 147715.3731288784
Fill us out some more tea , Kinch . : 20316.046841878557
Would you like a cup , ma’am ? : 22996.931158990308
—No , thank you , sir , the old woman said , slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go. : 16006.469420719546
Haines said to her: : 70187.024582051
—Have you your bill ? : 44926.22294796299
We had better pay her , Mulligan , hadn’t we ? : 38434.04826385276
Stephen filled again the three cups. : 33357.88629072669
—Bill , sir ? : 235869.68658941492
she said , halting . : 120564.14303239262
Well , it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling . : 11526.281824011154
That’s a shilling and one and two is two and two , sir. : 14971.934895739323
Buck Mulligan sighed and , having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides , stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets. : 14267.765461300069
—Pay up and look pleasant , Haines said to him , smiling. : 17074.485727900726
Stephen filled a third cup , a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk . : 12735.096453014077
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in his fingers and cried: : 13655.806302386705
—A miracle ! : 147721.71540071006
He passed it along the table towards the old woman , saying: : 16852.983258719516
—Ask nothing more of me , sweet . : 29805.400829913528
All I can give you I give. : 61824.58657127998
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand. : 22978.97309831874
—We’ll owe twopence , he said. : 33313.06199184208
—Time enough , sir , she said , taking the coin . : 37108.52455986639
Time enough . : 346323.6241077884
Good morning , sir. : 70175.99287917503
She curtseyed and went out , followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant: : 21222.39489359223
_—Heart of my heart , were it more , : 65630.37881424399
More would be laid at your feet._ : 26942.268783837706
He turned to Stephen and said: : 37715.52085234918
—Seriously , Dedalus . : 70202.74128010684
I’m stony . : 147721.71540071006
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money . : 19628.328240010916
Today the bards must drink and junket . : 22999.514245861126
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty. : 16961.896587849445
—That reminds me , Haines said , rising , that I have to visit your national library today. : 15434.812372091003
—Our swim first , Buck Mulligan said. : 26971.476947719948
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: : 29962.95041979154
—Is this the day for your monthly wash , Kinch ? : 16958.380602688114
Then he said to Haines: : 163039.4260504769
—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month. : 20887.55720673261
—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream , Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf. : 11501.728281151565
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: : 14013.956348020418
—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me. : 19747.668946152746
Speaking to me . : 226210.53256902212
They wash and tub and scrub . : 28578.37041885196
Agenbite of inwit. Conscience . : 44926.22294796299
Yet here’s a spot. : 145811.2223627505
—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good. : 14544.944582120525
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: : 14253.296195899939
—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet , Haines. : 20315.181771860505
—Well , I mean it , Haines said , still speaking to Stephen . : 14237.642770336079
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in. : 17481.924924258554
—Would I make any money by it ? : 39963.17660277661
Stephen asked. : 654070.9864952827
Haines laughed and , as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock , said: : 20246.991143119212
—I don’t know , I’m sure. : 33350.82110260668
He strolled out to the doorway . : 29869.267843176323
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: : 16962.933213377084
—You put your hoof in it now . : 35715.66384299072
What did you say that for ? : 171427.64488865546
—Well ? : 654070.9864952827
Stephen said . : 477931.78174938937
The problem is to get money . : 26007.307360226743
From whom ? : 295538.4614243839
From the milkwoman or from him . : 99857.24309637133
It’s a toss up , I think. : 26939.170155691405
—I blow him out about you , Buck Mulligan said , and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes. : 13999.436451646747
—I see little hope , Stephen said , from her or from him. : 19617.33838944903
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm. : 16964.280745763634
—From me , Kinch , he said. : 26921.017764850025
In a suddenly changed tone he added: : 44345.88502376653
—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right . : 23358.202021330373
Damn all else they are good for . : 35709.14931355693
Why don’t you play them as I do ? : 43046.595983690604
To hell with them all. Let us get out of the kip. : 19444.554296113794
He stood up , gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown , saying resignedly: : 14331.300536636178
—Mulligan is stripped of his garments. : 33262.36701957586
He emptied his pockets on to the table. : 25142.072531894184
—There’s your snotrag , he said. : 33313.06199184208
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them , chiding them , and to his dangling watchchain . : 15380.696111008954
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief . : 14020.939820027937
God , we’ll simply have to dress the character . : 26163.855581442105
I want puce gloves and green boots . : 22242.900478295272
Contradiction . : 654070.9864952827
Do I contradict myself ? : 137784.3723972025
Very well then , I contradict myself . : 49106.33610990292
Mercurial Malachi . : 147721.71540071006
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands. : 33724.528081860204
—And there’s your Latin quarter hat , he said. : 20297.261837168993
Stephen picked it up and put it on . : 25595.006984342945
Haines called to them from the doorway: : 26927.85678618656
—Are you coming , you fellows ? : 26957.46166648949
—I’m ready , Buck Mulligan answered , going towards the door . : 25027.565437641602
Come out , Kinch . : 90851.51315546791
You have eaten all we left , I suppose . : 32557.619744898246
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait , saying , wellnigh with sorrow: : 17278.528881071168
—And going forth he met Butterly. : 33362.90043662681
Stephen , taking his ashplant from its leaningplace , followed them out and , as they went down the ladder , pulled to the slow iron door and locked it . : 17477.120894254
He put the huge key in his inner pocket. : 22031.9058882512
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: : 24273.508537661277
—Did you bring the key ? : 33362.90043662681
—I have it , Stephen said , preceding them. : 20293.990900496905
He walked on . : 342374.43418460246
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses. : 12371.281684525808
—Down , sir ! : 70198.33175338316
How dare you , sir ! : 70306.70037765388
Haines asked: : 654070.9864952827
—Do you pay rent for this tower ? : 22995.439102045286
—Twelve quid , Buck Mulligan said. : 33362.90043662681
—To the secretary of state for war , Stephen added over his shoulder. : 14972.955045268587
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: : 17598.243643386246
—Rather bleak in wintertime , I should say . : 32765.500112110403
Martello you call it ? : 195158.86404466393
—Billy Pitt had them built , Buck Mulligan said , when the French were on the sea . : 16576.763400368574
But ours is the _omphalos_. : 44484.18272014328
—What is your idea of Hamlet ? : 26960.598600731137
Haines asked Stephen. : 147721.71540071006
—No , no , Buck Mulligan shouted in pain . : 32894.01105521327
I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up . : 16581.090230551425
Wait till I have a few pints in me first. : 33747.524689864644
He turned to Stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: : 16503.267014239518
—You couldn’t manage it under three pints , Kinch , could you ? : 16973.568198836427
—It has waited so long , Stephen said listlessly , it can wait longer. : 18330.429678006487
—You pique my curiosity , Haines said amiably . : 20315.46503968647
Is it some paradox ? : 65781.16212835841
—Pooh ! : 654070.9864952827
Buck Mulligan said . : 169353.91770043052
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It’s quite simple . : 26308.516240508234
He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father. : 14223.302168509188
—What ? : 654070.9864952827
Haines said , beginning to point at Stephen . : 20311.355071808848
He himself ? : 442810.2299624791
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and , bending in loose laughter , said to Stephen’s ear: : 13376.396518535472
—O , shade of Kinch the elder ! : 22997.292045104015
Japhet in search of a father ! : 67652.88403655155
—We’re always tired in the morning , Stephen said to Haines . : 22951.138919112997
And it is rather long to tell. : 85277.49774758247
Buck Mulligan , walking forward again , raised his hands. : 18391.874198250563
—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus , he said. : 14963.072425043021
—I mean to say , Haines explained to Stephen as they followed , this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore . : 13066.44691743795
_That beetles o’er his base into the sea , _ isn’t it ? : 16039.367648877742
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak . : 37340.84518613724
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires. : 14489.076600647893
—It’s a wonderful tale , Haines said , bringing them to halt again. : 14967.787721740486
Eyes , pale as the sea the wind had freshened , paler , firm and prudent. The seas’ ruler , he gazed southward over the bay , empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins. : 9095.296052200107
—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere , he said bemused. The Father and the Son idea . : 13429.299227854297
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father. : 29083.3560897927
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face . : 21259.90565900831
He looked at them , his wellshaped mouth open happily , his eyes , from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense , blinking with mad gaiety . : 16029.585641793545
He moved a doll’s head to and fro , the brims of his Panama hat quivering , and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: : 12229.0155754996
_—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard. My mother’s a jew , my father’s a bird. With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree. So here’s to disciples and Calvary._ : 10047.412017989906
He held up a forefinger of warning. : 29965.693976254075
_—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again._ : 9652.79567887562
He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and , running forward to a brow of the cliff , fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air , and chanted: : 10287.820162885148
_—Goodbye , now , goodbye ! : 33348.65946953044
Write down all I said And tell Tom , Dick and Harry I rose from the dead. What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet’s breezy... Goodbye , now , goodbye ! : 9644.914544694519
_ : 56776224.999992244
He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole , fluttering his winglike hands , leaping nimbly , Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries. : 10004.03150960488
Haines , who had been laughing guardedly , walked on beside Stephen and said: : 21876.590390727906
—We oughtn’t to laugh , I suppose . : 40219.40143647076
He’s rather blasphemous . : 70202.74128010684
I’m not a believer myself , that is to say . : 48727.01452212673
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow , doesn’t it ? : 18725.711067104625
What did he call it ? : 74753.12072914999
Joseph the Joiner ? : 70202.74128010684
—The ballad of joking Jesus , Stephen answered. : 22999.514245861126
—O , Haines said , you have heard it before ? : 36269.46348275499
—Three times a day , after meals , Stephen said drily. : 22115.741913216236
—You’re not a believer , are you ? : 63100.092159981294
Haines asked . : 147721.71540071006
I mean , a believer in the narrow sense of the word . : 54040.75913098213
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God. : 20309.645444266207
—There’s only one sense of the word , it seems to me , Stephen said. : 34508.796151533694
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone . : 13160.744544755655
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it. : 19799.320205980373
—Thank you , Stephen said , taking a cigarette. : 20299.136341873367
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to . : 28110.07802151243
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox , sprang it open too , and , having lit his cigarette , held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands. : 11683.457117279924
—Yes , of course , he said , as they went on again . : 52312.08827018887
Either you believe or you don’t , isn’t it ? : 20127.51433234551
Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal God . : 23343.70913930219
You don’t stand for that , I suppose ? : 83784.45141267276
—You behold in me , Stephen said with grim displeasure , a horrible example of free thought. : 12731.036610889045
He walked on , waiting to be spoken to , trailing his ashplant by his side . : 19391.326482448672
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path , squealing at his heels. My familiar , after me , calling , Steeeeeeeeeeeephen ! : 11296.059419252577
A wavering line along the path . : 38864.03827168861
They will walk on it tonight , coming here in the dark. He wants that key . : 13027.400030536637
It is mine . : 105326.55645963218
I paid the rent . : 42585.956778396656
Now I eat his salt bread . : 44615.12533796697
Give him the key too . : 33352.188768999644
All . : 2055530.0980201538
He will ask for it . : 61312.52868381293
That was in his eyes. : 137480.52621722955
—After all , Haines began... : 44906.90266424759
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind. : 20421.823731661734
—After all , I should think you are able to free yourself . : 43583.777774405295
You are your own master , it seems to me. : 54350.23194045371
—I am a servant of two masters , Stephen said , an English and an Italian. : 13159.933543503532
—Italian ? : 654070.9864952827
Haines said. : 654070.9864952827
A crazy queen , old and jealous . : 31659.980790253645
Kneel down before me. : 70202.74128010684
—And a third , Stephen said , there is who wants me for odd jobs. : 15688.614707709297
—Italian ? : 654070.9864952827
Haines said again . : 113051.09488670189
What do you mean ? : 644593.7821204909
—The imperial British state , Stephen answered , his colour rising , and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church. : 11303.927205905984
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke. : 15850.859593124345
—I can quite understand that , he said calmly . : 22625.158293815803
An Irishman must think like that , I daresay . : 18378.722988057692
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly . : 35283.73894946832
It seems history is to blame. : 35089.03986708652
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts , a chemistry of stars . : 9306.584718356691
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus , the voices blended , singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs . : 9564.928396473737
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one , and Arius , warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father , and Valentine , spurning Christ’s terrene body , and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son . : 9995.155971740161
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger . : 14945.260866086719
Idle mockery . : 147721.71540071006
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace , a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church , Michael’s host , who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields. : 10519.447410208273
Hear , hear ! : 70202.74128010684
Prolonged applause . : 147721.71540071006
_Zut ! : 654070.9864952827
Nom de Dieu ! : 70202.74128010684
_ : 56776224.999992244
—Of course I’m a Britisher , Haines’s voice said , and I feel as one . : 23628.69084803161
I don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. That’s our national problem , I’m afraid , just now. : 14117.385627431144
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff , watching: businessman , boatman. : 14218.156063176131
—She’s making for Bullock harbour. : 44926.22294796299
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain. : 15482.73249492319
—There’s five fathoms out there , he said . : 37819.44970594459
It’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one . : 18329.53273422568
It’s nine days today. : 70202.74128010684
The man that was drowned . : 31987.919416868757
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up , roll over to the sun a puffy face , saltwhite . : 13121.612937681739
Here I am. : 477952.30475725327
They followed the winding path down to the creek . : 19112.41352143475
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone , in shirtsleeves , his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder . : 12362.668175234134
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him , moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water. : 17726.557390477363
—Is the brother with you , Malachi ? : 27115.160599826428
—Down in Westmeath . : 70202.74128010684
With the Bannons. : 674241.5233481934
—Still there ? : 477972.8260027753
I got a card from Bannon . : 25963.60129041401
Says he found a sweet young thing down there . : 23131.65763954146
Photo girl he calls her. : 44926.22294796299
—Snapshot , eh ? : 70202.74128010684
Brief exposure. : 654070.9864952827
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots . : 26198.541536868768
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face . : 17279.546015418346
He scrambled up by the stones , water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair , water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth. : 10857.286091750895
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and , glancing at Haines and Stephen , crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone. : 12520.717945573831
—Seymour’s back in town , the young man said , grasping again his spur of rock . : 15666.11660134998
Chucked medicine and going in for the army. : 22960.08851990202
—Ah , go to God ! : 54301.91362007494
Buck Mulligan said. : 147721.71540071006
—Going over next week to stew . : 26972.94199183353
You know that red Carlisle girl , Lily ? : 23304.05675519821
—Yes. : 56776224.999992244
—Spooning with him last night on the pier . : 30007.321466682464
The father is rotto with money. : 31993.348986197096
—Is she up the pole ? : 33352.149240220904
—Better ask Seymour that. : 70202.74128010684
—Seymour a bleeding officer ! : 44926.22294796299
Buck Mulligan said. : 147721.71540071006
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying tritely: : 17171.566897245833
—Redheaded women buck like goats. : 44926.22294796299
He broke off in alarm , feeling his side under his flapping shirt. : 20774.550951769597
—My twelfth rib is gone , he cried . : 30014.960322492574
I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless Kinch and I , the supermen. : 18358.359348549195
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay. : 17151.24212752241
—Are you going in here , Malachi ? : 35714.259387806414
—Yes . : 654070.9864952827
Make room in the bed. : 90454.10499315456
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes . : 14959.734758908904
Haines sat down on a stone , smoking. : 35710.330757135285
—Are you not coming in ? : 60002.400871333826
Buck Mulligan asked. : 147721.71540071006
—Later on , Haines said . : 59988.30922941445
Not on my breakfast. : 132988.31075291405
Stephen turned away. : 147721.71540071006
—I’m going , Mulligan , he said. : 26938.401367688846
—Give us that key , Kinch , Buck Mulligan said , to keep my chemise flat. : 25452.19305471043
Stephen handed him the key . : 33355.05338718572
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes. : 22999.514245861126
—And twopence , he said , for a pint . : 45201.343652264804
Throw it there. : 147721.71540071006
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap . : 20297.21108652344
Dressing , undressing . : 70202.74128010684
Buck Mulligan erect , with joined hands before him , said solemnly: : 21242.564361987355
—He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord . : 16915.408065402473
Thus spake Zarathustra. : 147721.71540071006
His plump body plunged. : 90575.11215959559
—We’ll see you again , Haines said , turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish. : 15950.136520278107
Horn of a bull , hoof of a horse , smile of a Saxon. : 14227.589509255075
—The Ship , Buck Mulligan cried . : 26973.47498138647
Half twelve. : 654070.9864952827
—Good , Stephen said. : 70202.74128010684
He walked along the upwardcurving path. : 37715.52116272921
Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet. Iubilantium te virginum. : 26974.43105546525
The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly . : 15513.86913497107
I will not sleep here tonight . : 43237.072275977305
Home also I cannot go. : 44896.61126388518
A voice , sweettoned and sustained , called to him from the sea . : 21066.007042621895
Turning the curve he waved his hand . : 49175.13580738493
It called again . : 121995.51000261129
A sleek brown head , a seal’s , far out on the water , round. : 19193.819274169513
Usurper. : 56776224.999992244
[ <NUM> ] : 147721.71540071006
—You , Cochrane , what city sent for him ? : 29164.50604613841
—Tarentum , sir. : 147721.71540071006
—Very good . : 147689.9985937089
Well ? : 2348973.520800131
—There was a battle , sir. : 33320.12942993556
—Very good . : 147689.9985937089
Where ? : 3806582.195480173
The boy’s blank face asked the blank window. : 22288.435294360657
Fabled by the daughters of memory . : 26932.291993426643
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it . : 25101.73167399847
A phrase , then , of impatience , thud of Blake’s wings of excess . : 18210.958673033638
I hear the ruin of all space , shattered glass and toppling masonry , and time one livid final flame . : 11343.969282112932
What’s left us then ? : 44925.06562279552
—I forget the place , sir . : 35406.39590453363
<NUM> B. C. : 147721.71540071006
—Asculum , Stephen said , glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book. : 13633.606288377823
—Yes , sir . : 70198.33175338316
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done for._ : 23144.43551961517
That phrase the world had remembered . : 36299.13279205062
A dull ease of the mind . : 58755.66349614967
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers , leaned upon his spear . : 13442.309322791687
Any general to any officers . : 33353.15011473313
They lend ear. : 169034.9074792272
—You , Armstrong , Stephen said . : 44615.946292605026
What was the end of Pyrrhus ? : 40950.43358743295
—End of Pyrrhus , sir ? : 74841.50384918968
—I know , sir . : 44904.447996119736
Ask me , sir , Comyn said. : 44581.472645919486
—Wait . : 654070.9864952827
You , Armstrong . : 95662.23728577876
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus ? : 86514.75522611402
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel . : 23759.1425297576
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly . : 15845.759888397208
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips . : 41397.790394236144
A sweetened boy’s breath . : 74916.63619766088
Welloff people , proud that their eldest son was in the navy . : 17818.441043331382
Vico Road , Dalkey. : 70202.74128010684
—Pyrrhus , sir ? : 235869.68658941492
Pyrrhus , a pier. : 70107.890738572
All laughed . : 316939.94562868436
Mirthless high malicious laughter . : 90881.44561819625
Armstrong looked round at his classmates , silly glee in profile . : 15852.894453958037
In a moment they will laugh more loudly , aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay. : 20794.03276846313
—Tell me now , Stephen said , poking the boy’s shoulder with the book , what is a pier. : 13579.326206505653
—A pier , sir , Armstrong said . : 55479.48053969251
A thing out in the water . : 64073.696641796116
A kind of a bridge . : 91722.05474412921
Kingstown pier , sir. : 70202.74128010684
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning . : 35720.57531114476
Two in the back bench whispered . : 26885.750283861005
Yes . : 654028.8642034819
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. All . : 24236.70390391328
With envy he watched their faces: Edith , Ethel , Gerty , Lily . : 16018.407538603533
Their likes: their breaths , too , sweetened with tea and jam , their bracelets tittering in the struggle. : 14734.833665174716
—Kingstown pier , Stephen said . : 60010.13227348695
Yes , a disappointed bridge. : 44852.65882379528
The words troubled their gaze. : 42726.73947819277
—How , sir ? : 235869.68658941492
Comyn asked . : 147721.71540071006
A bridge is across a river. : 51089.199782858705
For Haines’s chapbook . : 133030.74467174814
No-one here to hear . : 74866.93363220591
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk , to pierce the polished mail of his mind . : 18574.82354602818
What then ? : 207529.46763604027
A jester at the court of his master , indulged and disesteemed , winning a clement master’s praise . : 16576.608706687013
Why had they chosen all that part ? : 29818.945610221628
Not wholly for the smooth caress . : 38792.90662564846
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard , their land a pawnshop. : 14251.642632147494
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death . : 13322.555221890303
They are not to be thought away . : 115475.53500805472
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted . : 12915.589040717812
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were ? : 21158.81854847535
Or was that only possible which came to pass ? : 18392.289652862666
Weave , weaver of the wind. : 33192.434902307374
—Tell us a story , sir. : 33360.75176744622
—O , do , sir . : 33343.90759795519
A ghoststory. : 2348663.440998149
—Where do you begin in this ? : 36290.80107368151
Stephen asked , opening another book. : 33362.18422894433
—_Weep no more , _ Comyn said. : 38850.75334252601
—Go on then , Talbot. : 44905.48846946252
—And the story , sir ? : 134612.2683414882
—After , Stephen said . : 90876.76306101568
Go on , Talbot. : 70164.45029073142
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel . : 14789.455375107387
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: : 18127.512836572332
_—Weep no more , woful shepherds , weep no more For Lycidas , your sorrow , is not dead , Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._ : 12316.401389065357
It must be a movement then , an actuality of the possible as possible. Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read , sheltered from the sin of Paris , night by night . : 12748.96752111274
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy . : 19189.40314526253
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps , impaled , with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld , reluctant , shy of brightness , shifting her dragon scaly folds . : 9519.839248022341
Thought is the thought of thought . : 44581.532560068015
Tranquil brightness . : 147721.71540071006
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms . : 17259.314014292107
Tranquility sudden , vast , candescent: form of forms. : 20316.919201716766
Talbot repeated: : 654070.9864952827
_—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves , : 16964.66823466252
Through the dear might..._ : 70202.74128010684
—Turn over , Stephen said quietly . : 26969.029823507142
I don’t see anything. : 65668.05553403238
—What , sir ? : 235869.68658941492
Talbot asked simply , bending forward. : 33362.90043662681
His hand turned the page over . : 31197.490498415285
He leaned back and went on again , having just remembered . : 22600.14373558874
Of him that walked the waves . : 44611.84018946105
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine . : 15736.386076068631
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute . : 13913.599992391113
To Caesar what is Caesar’s , to God what is God’s . : 17674.73226923078
A long look from dark eyes , a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms . : 13349.138787932205
Ay. : 56776224.999992244
Riddle me , riddle me , randy ro. My father gave me seeds to sow. : 13653.31611896031
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel. : 22999.143943681538
—Have I heard all ? : 71028.17975876303
Stephen asked. : 654070.9864952827
—Yes , sir . : 70198.33175338316
Hockey at ten , sir. : 44923.90832744141
—Half day , sir . : 44902.2128210437
Thursday. : 56776224.999992244
—Who can answer a riddle ? : 33362.18422894433
Stephen asked. : 654070.9864952827
They bundled their books away , pencils clacking , pages rustling. Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels , all gabbling gaily: : 11303.155880795135
—A riddle , sir ? : 118455.2613640953
Ask me , sir. : 70116.7064029129
—O , ask me , sir. : 33335.63692723039
—A hard one , sir. : 44912.384482394955
—This is the riddle , Stephen said: : 26959.566560264866
The cock crew , The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. ’Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven. : 10659.625947429839
What is that ? : 453796.4671803662
—What , sir ? : 235869.68658941492
—Again , sir . : 70198.33175338316
We didn’t hear. : 346397.6555345759
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated . : 31188.960296081135
After a silence Cochrane said: : 239451.59195839142
—What is it , sir ? : 134442.64560538525
We give it up. : 133013.7143580396
Stephen , his throat itching , answered: : 26957.549436607736
—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush. : 22998.77364746398
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay. : 13781.92297835692
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: : 24974.6672860704
—Hockey ! : 654070.9864952827
They broke asunder , sidling out of their benches , leaping them . : 20704.738238181064
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues. : 18108.135166741315
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly , showing an open copybook . : 14256.134755788089
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading . : 12099.502778931028
On his cheek , dull and bloodless , a soft stain of ink lay , dateshaped , recent and damp as a snail’s bed. : 13699.900002852934
He held out his copybook . : 37717.12062317854
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline. Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot . : 11192.399391980958
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal. : 33360.03514451585
—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again , he said , and show them to you , sir. : 20838.717997602267
Stephen touched the edges of the book . : 35584.16261005975
Futility. : 56776224.999992244
—Do you understand how to do them now ? : 30036.03861476922
he asked. : 2821620.7786225514
—Numbers eleven to fifteen , Sargent answered . : 33145.388754796964
Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board , sir. : 19496.919062994886
—Can you do them yourself ? : 60004.03513532216
Stephen asked. : 654070.9864952827
—No , sir. : 147721.71540071006
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink , a snail’s bed . : 15040.264058158384
Yet someone had loved him , borne him in her arms and in her heart . : 39012.23203330437
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot , a squashed boneless snail . : 12858.1895874144
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own . : 32581.538561001875
Was that then real ? : 80621.22855875334
The only true thing in life ? : 43036.8238425027
His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode . : 17260.70239432888
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire , an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes . : 16245.206814162937
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone , scarcely having been . : 18132.81287244225
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox , red reek of rapine in his fur , with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth , listened , scraped up the earth , listened , scraped and scraped. : 10507.579462972883
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem . : 37208.22954089555
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather . : 18139.047829501913
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses . : 22998.773599762393
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field. : 13128.861873970018
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice , in the mummery of their letters , wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes . : 11073.740561038807
Give hands , traverse , bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors . : 13138.709707668615
Gone too from the world , Averroes and Moses Maimonides , dark men in mien and movement , flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world , a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend. : 10824.5435610511
—Do you understand now ? : 44926.22294796299
Can you work the second for yourself ? : 51475.63849691416
—Yes , sir. : 147721.71540071006
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data . : 21614.285673815946
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols , a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin . : 11714.738678049453
_Amor matris:_ subjective and objective genitive . : 26974.43105546525
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands. : 12767.409836386287
Like him was I , these sloping shoulders , this gracelessness . : 15852.21038409908
My childhood bends beside me . : 71262.69074921524
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly . : 17565.78115450355
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes . : 26153.441049344066
Secrets , silent , stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants , willing to be dethroned. : 10741.033521206253
The sum was done. : 65933.15784360672
—It is very simple , Stephen said as he stood up. : 16954.263999999817
—Yes , sir . : 70198.33175338316
Thanks , Sargent answered. : 70202.74128010684
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench. : 14844.926532716547
—You had better get your stick and go out to the others , Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form. : 13285.177213455094
—Yes , sir. : 147721.71540071006
In the corridor his name was heard , called from the playfield. : 20079.250812907405
—Sargent ! : 654070.9864952827
—Run on , Stephen said . : 59988.30922941445
Mr Deasy is calling you. : 49834.223974306835
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife . : 11922.834792517166
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him . : 13099.760154774827
He turned his angry white moustache. : 37718.74003642331
—What is it now ? : 44920.46400182496
he cried continually without listening. : 80621.22855875334
—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side , sir , Stephen said. : 24554.159482240655
—Will you wait in my study for a moment , Mr Deasy said , till I restore order here. : 14808.14804269036
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly: : 14619.200171100756
—What is the matter ? : 329592.67093322246
What is it now ? : 177374.50143930138
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him , the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head. : 11348.160459216599
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs . : 15016.104517777718
As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was in the beginning , is now . : 29066.924502129652
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins , base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be . : 18696.902632696085
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush , faded , the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end. : 12449.02812007427
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor . : 22428.346290996855
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table. : 16953.6815335088
—First , our little financial settlement , he said. : 20296.09981195104
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong . : 19293.184188940424
It slapped open and he took from it two notes , one of joined halves , and laid them carefully on the table. : 14845.173679257407
—Two , he said , strapping and stowing his pocketbook away. : 24739.397120916725
And now his strongroom for the gold . : 40506.85663460027
Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this , whorled as an emir’s turban , and this , the scallop of saint James . : 10425.859036877893
An old pilgrim’s hoard , dead treasure , hollow shells. : 18398.888279265087
A sovereign fell , bright and new , on the soft pile of the tablecloth. : 17876.25527560978
—Three , Mr Deasy said , turning his little savingsbox about in his hand. These are handy things to have . : 13621.486113175608
See . : 654070.9864952827
This is for sovereigns . : 106972.23264515407
This is for shillings . : 106972.23264515407
Sixpences , halfcrowns . : 70202.74128010684
And here crowns . : 90575.11215959559
See. : 56776224.999992244
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings. : 22047.67649691566
—Three twelve , he said . : 84748.75735281763
I think you’ll find that’s right. : 57377.96914053464
—Thank you , sir , Stephen said , gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers. : 14251.881282339356
—No thanks at all , Mr Deasy said . : 34790.1494358818
You have earned it. : 230674.7418700856
Stephen’s hand , free again , went back to the hollow shells . : 19592.20879109704
Symbols too of beauty and of power . : 35709.132121657756
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery. : 21398.577402298393
—Don’t carry it like that , Mr Deasy said . : 26159.88138479497
You’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it . : 32976.753384354786
You just buy one of these machines . : 26838.83087155882
You’ll find them very handy. : 44921.593378908365
Answer something. : 654070.9864952827
—Mine would be often empty , Stephen said. : 22975.14747222119
The same room and hour , the same wisdom: and I the same . : 35674.7384211255
Three times now . : 408530.18103992817
Three nooses round me here . : 107940.9617281144
Well ? : 2348973.520800131
I can break them in this instant if I will. : 25450.793111082658
—Because you don’t save , Mr Deasy said , pointing his finger . : 14970.755364367309
You don’t know yet what money is . : 41696.98716234656
Money is power . : 169359.37187808988
When you have lived as long as I have . : 83411.56682828369
I know , I know . : 187333.26282357384
If youth but knew . : 55089.607142381145
But what does Shakespeare say ? : 81848.4727023634
_Put but money in thy purse._ : 33362.90043662681
—Iago , Stephen murmured. : 70202.74128010684
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare. : 15806.810857760322
—He knew what money was , Mr Deasy said . : 26161.56327107886
He made money . : 84371.72439904427
A poet , yes , but an Englishman too . : 33750.63362827135
Do you know what is the pride of the English ? : 60207.46435428358
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s mouth ? : 23538.738575620144
The seas’ ruler . : 65933.15784360672
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words , unhating. : 13888.639395698587
—That on his empire , Stephen said , the sun never sets. : 15826.830489133785
—Ba ! : 654070.9864952827
Mr Deasy cried . : 79911.97647744791
That’s not English . : 70202.74128010684
A French Celt said that . : 51080.42481466374
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail. : 29965.14252219946
—I will tell you , he said solemnly , what is his proudest boast . : 26314.436949707466
_I paid my way._ : 70202.74128010684
Good man , good man. : 44903.37540998384
_—I paid my way . : 74905.38471448774
I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel that ? : 19226.20903047611
_I owe nothing._ Can you ? : 43788.68162064597
Mulligan , nine pounds , three pairs of socks , one pair brogues , ties. Curran , ten guineas . : 11773.302937610768
McCann , one guinea . : 44918.14804479664
Fred Ryan , two shillings. Temple , two lunches . : 18398.414313392554
Russell , one guinea , Cousins , ten shillings , Bob Reynolds , half a guinea , Koehler , three guineas , Mrs MacKernan , five weeks’ board . : 10250.292448046219
The lump I have is useless. : 31950.123940962592
—For the moment , no , Stephen answered. : 40751.734110337384
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight , putting back his savingsbox. : 17781.64691804238
—I knew you couldn’t , he said joyously . : 25575.001660955106
But one day you must feel it. We are a generous people but we must also be just. : 17651.542508961687
—I fear those big words , Stephen said , which make us so unhappy. : 14244.325492940594
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward , prince of Wales. : 13231.730180046372
—You think me an old fogey and an old tory , his thoughtful voice said. I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time . : 12156.097792830347
I remember the famine in ’46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue ? : 14817.050934170204
You fenians forget some things. : 57546.67904920329
Glorious , pious and immortal memory . : 26973.934713100607
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes . : 14003.35198295724
Hoarse , masked and armed , the planters’ covenant . : 18369.680025033835
The black north and true blue bible . : 22289.15306492247
Croppies lie down. : 147721.71540071006
Stephen sketched a brief gesture. : 44926.22294796299
—I have rebel blood in me too , Mr Deasy said . : 21262.248592758402
On the spindle side . : 118031.02688413636
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union . : 19307.026254981593
We are all Irish , all kings’ sons. : 31646.758939094656
—Alas , Stephen said. : 70202.74128010684
—_Per vias rectas_ , Mr Deasy said firmly , was his motto . : 19616.07049468824
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so. : 16681.82483077143
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin. : 18398.651294802596
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots . : 26992.751245716605
Soft day , sir John ! : 33348.041201782944
Soft day , your honour ! : 33341.57623487723
... Day ! : 147721.71540071006
... Day ! : 147721.71540071006
... Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin . : 20313.441436695746
Lal the ral the ra . : 33362.90043662681
Lal the ral the raddy. : 44926.22294796299
—That reminds me , Mr Deasy said . : 51452.62826732486
You can do me a favour , Mr Dedalus , with some of your literary friends . : 37235.94496151289
I have a letter here for the press. Sit down a moment . : 32704.608970218807
I have just to copy the end. : 48417.659452600965
He went to the desk near the window , pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter. : 12909.50787565475
—Sit down . : 147696.50124456148
Excuse me , he said over his shoulder , _the dictates of common sense._ Just a moment. : 14385.252125403775
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and , muttering , began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly , sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error. : 10463.261771096657
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence . : 20311.688143827745
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage , their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ _Repulse_ , the duke of Westminster’s _Shotover_ , the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_ , _prix de Paris_ , 1866. Elfin riders sat them , watchful of a sign . : 9032.270100553113
He saw their speeds , backing king’s colours , and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds. : 13242.789181217733
—Full stop , Mr Deasy bade his keys . : 20317.590926335102
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question..._ : 26956.27528563984
Where Cranly led me to get rich quick , hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes , amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen , over the motley slush . : 11729.641489432894
Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to one the field . : 26166.888821871093
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs , the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman , a butcher’s dame , nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange. : 10041.863878221264
Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle. : 16943.977117277136
Again: a goal . : 70202.74128010684
I am among them , among their battling bodies in a medley , the joust of life . : 18639.950320331445
You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick ? : 20572.564393042194
Jousts . : 654070.9864952827
Time shocked rebounds , shock by shock . : 22999.514245861126
Jousts , slush and uproar of battles , the frozen deathspew of the slain , a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts. : 10906.536641924358
—Now then , Mr Deasy said , rising. : 22986.650345561364
He came to the table , pinning together his sheets . : 51088.46094913302
Stephen stood up. : 147721.71540071006
—I have put the matter into a nutshell , Mr Deasy said . : 19629.37209922239
It’s about the foot and mouth disease . : 22993.621044632215
Just look through it . : 53110.02270207887
There can be no two opinions on the matter. : 42975.491677369784
May I trespass on your valuable space . : 35717.727629263005

Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on. : 29047.382955834673
Foot and mouth disease . : 44926.22294796299

Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns. : 22938.71519241596
—I want that to be printed and read , Mr Deasy said . : 25680.1998107025
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle . : 24951.64007622425
And it can be cured . : 71085.51426354305
It is cured . : 105333.34038303557
My cousin , Blackwood Price , writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there . : 13886.336869536062
They offer to come over here . : 47254.384692005966
I am trying to work up influence with the department . : 35086.16662946613
Now I’m going to try publicity . : 44602.98692309257
I am surrounded by difficulties , by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by... : 17177.70480901115
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke. : 15844.817792541222
—Mark my words , Mr Dedalus , he said . : 45778.75114373303
England is in the hands of the jews . : 41334.55356029145
In all the highest places: her finance , her press . : 17818.64812345019
And they are the signs of a nation’s decay . : 28939.8287998371
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength . : 16961.686089750583
I have seen it coming these years . : 66220.65733026738
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction . : 19363.037937509704
Old England is dying. : 70202.74128010684
He stepped swiftly off , his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam . : 15666.856148322942
He faced about and back again. : 37718.74003642331
—Dying , he said again , if not dead by now. : 33530.746035925185
The harlot’s cry from street to street Shall weave old England’s windingsheet. : 15527.092132589367
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted. : 16600.06776609128
—A merchant , Stephen said , is one who buys cheap and sells dear , jew or gentile , is he not ? : 12941.37309907777
—They sinned against the light , Mr Deasy said gravely . : 16960.958928340984
And you can see the darkness in their eyes . : 28957.951235231547
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day. : 16176.959266766491
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers . : 23891.09405716467
Gabble of geese . : 70202.74128010684
They swarmed loud , uncouth about the temple , their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats . : 13043.599635400458
Not theirs: these clothes , this speech , these gestures. Their full slow eyes belied the words , the gestures eager and unoffending , but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain . : 12259.944596647281
Vain patience to heap and hoard . : 26973.934713100607
Time surely would scatter all . : 51075.30316904889
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their years of wandering and , patient , knew the dishonours of their flesh. : 11519.328479114376
—Who has not ? : 70173.44875891674
Stephen said. : 654070.9864952827
—What do you mean ? : 193200.3776384462
Mr Deasy asked. : 175586.31393135735
He came forward a pace and stood by the table . : 47353.35670806904
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly . : 31202.08482189009
Is this old wisdom ? : 133075.84737794075
He waits to hear from me. : 37698.655051344984
—History , Stephen said , is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake. : 28793.37380933973
From the playfield the boys raised a shout . : 35425.693636600896
A whirring whistle: goal. What if that nightmare gave you a back kick ? : 17111.481420421962
—The ways of the Creator are not our ways , Mr Deasy said . : 23523.174311766114
All human history moves towards one great goal , the manifestation of God. : 17835.812439926292
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window , saying: : 28108.398277610424
—That is God. : 147721.71540071006
Hooray ! : 654070.9864952827
Ay ! : 654070.9864952827
Whrrwhee ! : 654070.9864952827
—What ? : 654070.9864952827
Mr Deasy asked. : 175586.31393135735
—A shout in the street , Stephen answered , shrugging his shoulders. : 24984.50890923021
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers . : 12721.40783955128
Looking up again he set them free. : 26973.438315931293
—I am happier than you are , he said . : 61292.65244295168
We have committed many errors and many sins . : 39917.11463628036
A woman brought sin into the world . : 51381.871755191925
For a woman who was no better than she should be , Helen , the runaway wife of Menelaus , ten years the Greeks made war on Troy . : 15770.442976729344
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here , MacMurrough’s wife and her leman , O’Rourke , prince of Breffni . : 12154.380660524483
A woman too brought Parnell low . : 38866.881307370815
Many errors , many failures but not the one sin . : 23358.65457292192
I am a struggler now at the end of my days . : 39297.79931521188
But I will fight for the right till the end. : 27403.122529421616
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right. : 26971.27359162999
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand. : 26946.724105071935
—Well , sir , he began. : 59915.43703622411
—I foresee , Mr Deasy said , that you will not remain here very long at this work . : 24780.35403783962
You were not born to be a teacher , I think . : 54622.76661012513
Perhaps I am wrong. : 983003.2939412446
—A learner rather , Stephen said. : 33362.90043662681
And here what will you learn more ? : 26121.871280496605
Mr Deasy shook his head. : 49831.719835936776
—Who knows ? : 147721.71540071006
he said . : 1266210.5661733155
To learn one must be humble . : 53841.60135446881
But life is the great teacher. : 33083.436549523605
Stephen rustled the sheets again. : 44926.22294796299
—As regards these , he began. : 33310.916348140774
—Yes , Mr Deasy said . : 60010.53164621862
You have two copies there . : 108002.30531693276
If you can have them published at once. : 62992.318899587895

—I will try , Stephen said , and let you know tomorrow . : 28942.248593117674
I know two editors slightly. : 76390.89393514012
—That will do , Mr Deasy said briskly . : 20311.84426447803
I wrote last night to Mr Field , M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the City Arms hotel . : 11868.779293892845
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting . : 29727.13614422307
You see if you can get it into your two papers . : 31602.231465220637
What are they ? : 453883.8307624939
_—The Evening Telegraph..._ : 147721.71540071006
—That will do , Mr Deasy said . : 35711.09846328262
There is no time to lose . : 116998.63141266536
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin. : 48003.21961074852
—Good morning , sir , Stephen said , putting the sheets in his pocket. Thank you. : 16394.473381597796
—Not at all , Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk . : 14288.139819826563
I like to break a lance with you , old as I am. : 16225.7990444247
—Good morning , sir , Stephen said again , bowing to his bent back. : 18318.899026567764
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees , hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield . : 11369.656844548534
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors . : 12948.017353535615
Still I will help him in his fight . : 26953.728097598305
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard. : 18395.3322753306
—Mr Dedalus ! : 147721.71540071006
Running after me . : 145762.63925305216
No more letters , I hope. : 47129.99042537169
—Just one moment. : 147721.71540071006
—Yes , sir , Stephen said , turning back at the gate. : 21246.32563076473
Mr Deasy halted , breathing hard and swallowing his breath. : 19377.59542691666
—I just wanted to say , he said . : 43786.20324702416
Ireland , they say , has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews . : 14823.295619044356
Do you know that ? : 412012.3944700472
No . : 1851009.8923125966
And do you know why ? : 104129.16345575299
He frowned sternly on the bright air. : 29927.77555467021
—Why , sir ? : 235869.68658941492
Stephen asked , beginning to smile. : 33361.46803663681
—Because she never let them in , Mr Deasy said solemnly. : 32179.130123318566
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm . : 14804.096506074977
He turned back quickly , coughing , laughing , his lifted arms waving to the air. : 13761.25776527669
—She never let them in , he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path . : 16402.53964054459
That’s why. : 654070.9864952827
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles , dancing coins. : 18481.67685511541

Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells . : 14252.234611050879
You are walking through it howsomever . : 53228.97873180405
I am , a stride at a time . : 77382.47799324428
A very short space of time through very short times of space. Five , six: the _nacheinander_. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible . : 13972.836974923348

Looking for something lost in a past life . : 28080.870099003787
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare , ears flung back , chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull . : 11521.108024452833
The man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears . : 19758.73277713836

They waded a little way in the water and , stooping , soused their bags and , lifting them again , waded out . : 16812.123073552608
The dog yelped running to them , reared up and pawed them , dropping on all fours , again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning . : 10884.093179692762
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand , a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws . : 11101.806459817079
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop . : 14022.98160219608
The carcass lay on his path . : 26010.638552071585

He slunk back in a curve . : 29924.163217698584

He trotted forward and , lifting again his hindleg , pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock . : 12886.578657949824
The simple pleasures of the poor . : 102137.51755475924
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved. Something he buried there , his grandmother . : 12386.24818049114
He rooted in the sand , dabbling , delving and stopped to listen to the air , scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws , soon ceasing , a pard , a panther , got in spousebreach , vulturing the dead. : 9867.249473582488

Evening will find itself. : 70193.69768501107
He took the hilt of his ashplant , lunging with it softly , dallying still . : 20598.3788469488
Yes , evening will find itself in me , without me . : 20206.37957156839

Did I not take it up ? : 38858.36946003556
His hand groped vainly in his pockets . : 26100.903487981534
No , I didn’t . : 179260.48347328583
Better buy one. : 147721.71540071006
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock , carefully . : 13300.586415129092

He turned his face over a shoulder , rere regardant . : 18138.42112356312
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster , her sails brailed up on the crosstrees , homing , upstream , silently moving , a silent ship. : 11741.375960971336

[ <NUM> ] : 147721.71540071006
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He liked thick giblet soup , nutty gizzards , a stuffed roast heart , liverslices fried with crustcrumbs , fried hencods’ roes . : 9793.911970004132
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine. : 13620.422022311379
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly , righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray . : 15556.283715036529
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere . : 21264.63460725951
Made him feel a bit peckish. : 33361.48589669857
The coals were reddening. : 65933.15784360672
Another slice of bread and butter: three , four: right . : 32186.535703443336
She didn’t like her plate full . : 26886.918389247643
Right . : 654070.9864952827
He turned from the tray , lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire . : 14124.52033467199
It sat there , dull and squat , its spout stuck out . : 20095.021343478842
Cup of tea soon . : 80615.09939477177
Good . : 654070.9864952827
Mouth dry . : 147721.71540071006
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high. : 17216.910680494006
—Mkgnao ! : 654070.9864952827
—O , there you are , Mr Bloom said , turning from the fire. : 17543.10360327836
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table , mewing . : 16083.689155632039
Just how she stalks over my writingtable . : 22998.042024231774
Prr . : 654070.9864952827
Scratch my head . : 320886.85465815646
Prr. : 56776224.999992244
Mr Bloom watched curiously , kindly the lithe black form . : 17782.683172407556
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide , the white button under the butt of her tail , the green flashing eyes . : 14236.212215377323
He bent down to her , his hands on his knees. : 36719.28911104358
—Milk for the pussens , he said. : 26888.10718452085
—Mrkgnao ! : 654070.9864952827
the cat cried. : 346397.6555345759
They call them stupid . : 48707.60407452645
They understand what we say better than we understand them . : 19088.892909752372
She understands all she wants to . : 40824.95687145477
Vindictive too. Cruel . : 70202.74128010684
Her nature . : 244934.16829261938
Curious mice never squeal . : 44926.22294796299
Seem to like it . : 53104.5837546958
Wonder what I look like to her . : 48415.74572922726
Height of a tower ? : 44842.25816227077
No , she can jump me. : 124050.96667252146
—Afraid of the chickens she is , he said mockingly . : 20413.583537909675
Afraid of the chookchooks . : 44650.906803589256
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens. : 62255.99436428597
—Mrkrgnao ! : 654070.9864952827
the cat said loudly. : 133030.74467174814
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes , mewing plaintively and long , showing him her milkwhite teeth . : 12829.412282833655
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones . : 14348.63844617216
Then he went to the dresser , took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him , poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor. : 15787.432348677317
—Gurrhr ! : 654070.9864952827
she cried , running to lap. : 87902.76247391858
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly . : 12511.341180994876
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after . : 14968.270689998117
Why ? : 1850884.7781121505
They shine in the dark , perhaps , the tips . : 20577.908765438126
Or kind of feelers in the dark , perhaps. : 20260.623522102633
He listened to her licking lap . : 49487.34744921789
Ham and eggs , no . : 54292.60605656787
No good eggs with this drouth . : 36305.24962614807
Want pure fresh water . : 44926.22294796299
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley’s . : 14965.223571833249
Fried with butter , a shake of pepper. Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s . : 13658.370684721336
While the kettle is boiling . : 91894.57740760891
She lapped slower , then licking the saucer clean . : 18358.06504153153
Why are their tongues so rough ? : 36309.8961886796
To lap better , all porous holes . : 27125.098542795095
Nothing she can eat ? : 90876.87916944936
He glanced round him . : 66649.02166356969
No. : 56776224.999992244
On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall , paused by the bedroom door . : 21364.149602793197
She might like something tasty . : 33240.938853242464
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning . : 42532.804796694676
Still perhaps: once in a way. : 33307.53088268814
He said softly in the bare hall: : 29867.179169472543
—I’m going round the corner . : 60002.46416926224
Be back in a minute. : 44837.92074849951
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: : 35267.45696593971
—You don’t want anything for breakfast ? : 26973.438379868898
A sleepy soft grunt answered: : 74916.63619766088
—Mn. : 56776224.999992244
No . : 1851009.8923125966
She didn’t want anything . : 44728.06378583334
He heard then a warm heavy sigh , softer , as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. Must get those settled really . : 13678.811620081664
Pity . : 654070.9864952827
All the way from Gibraltar. Forgotten any little Spanish she knew . : 19186.559513122273
Wonder what her father gave for it . : 33102.50184119257
Old style . : 147721.71540071006
Ah yes ! : 279018.5657260161
of course . : 3091714.704148625
Bought it at the governor’s auction. Got a short knock . : 16951.72964614205
Hard as nails at a bargain , old Tweedy . : 18395.817537621242
Yes , sir . : 70151.716453902
At Plevna that was . : 98397.48882840844
I rose from the ranks , sir , and I’m proud of it . : 19706.265633822804
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps . : 19161.844994938692
Now that was farseeing. : 169305.35340230717
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof . : 12091.116671170874
Stamps: stickyback pictures . : 70202.74128010684
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too . : 24588.1703192124
Course they do. The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s high grade ha . : 11749.778786391442
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband . : 25216.725851786276
White slip of paper . : 44923.93704209566
Quite safe. : 654070.9864952827
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey . : 21675.364530036833
Not there. In the trousers I left off . : 37345.423617139546
Must get it . : 86536.59338047776
Potato I have . : 407687.79663884104
Creaky wardrobe . : 147721.71540071006
No use disturbing her . : 78134.81123979684
She turned over sleepily that time . : 36185.46443213164
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly , more , till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold , a limp lid . : 14345.906696219265
Looked shut . : 147721.71540071006
All right till I come back anyhow. : 61873.45635597153
He crossed to the bright side , avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive . : 14328.03517094498
The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church . : 25519.58279222425
Be a warm day I fancy . : 26972.458055346968
Specially in these black clothes feel it more . : 26199.99844401453
Black conducts , reflects , ( refracts is it ? : 20125.193236436648
) , the heat . : 143212.70193706983
But I couldn’t go in that light suit . : 36340.62738317166
Make a picnic of it . : 41798.71388387577
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth . : 28636.807651596282
Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot. Makes you feel young . : 11525.277409710789
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn . : 16927.5736492334
Travel round in front of the sun , steal a day’s march on him. Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically . : 15565.51413607094
Walk along a strand , strange land , come to a city gate , sentry there , old ranker too , old Tweedy’s big moustaches , leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander through awned streets . : 12110.831200231274
Turbaned faces going by . : 44925.06562279552
Dark caves of carpet shops , big man , Turko the terrible , seated crosslegged , smoking a coiled pipe . : 11525.408673582311
Cries of sellers in the streets . : 26885.25557326475
Drink water scented with fennel , sherbet . : 22999.514245861126
Dander along all day . : 183788.1949844017
Might meet a robber or two. Well , meet him . : 18977.159740112835
Getting on to sundown . : 44910.067330973376
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up . : 16949.3561143425
A shiver of the trees , signal , the evening wind . : 47140.2838791898
I pass on . : 110452.46881865243
Fading gold sky . : 70202.74128010684
A mother watches me from her doorway . : 31645.290380111866
She calls her children home in their dark language . : 18353.066435620225
High wall: beyond strings twanged . : 33362.90043662681
Night sky , moon , violet , colour of Molly’s new garters . : 14973.400128891002

Listen . : 654070.9864952827
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers . : 30136.802360156526
I pass. : 572301.727620578
Probably not a bit like it really . : 35708.58777570923
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun . : 15784.358649204045
Sunburst on the titlepage . : 44845.498672175425
He smiled , pleasing himself. What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland . : 12263.402718598227
He prolonged his pleased smile . : 67843.56112655197
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest. : 26107.600644372178
He approached Larry O’Rourke’s . : 52053.742711485604
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter . : 24054.385160695074
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger , teadust , biscuitmush . : 13164.290699298179
Good house , however: just the end of the city traffic . : 22935.974089073352
For instance M’Auley’s down there: n . : 38866.881307370815

Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot. : 12640.095750565817
Baldhead over the blind . : 44913.51618578859
Cute old codger . : 70202.74128010684
No use canvassing him for an ad . : 29826.493395259324
Still he knows his own business best . : 22985.873898127447
There he is , sure enough , my bold Larry , leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket . : 13664.403739173062
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up . : 23566.552459428945
Do you know what I’m going to tell you ? : 60273.784723087236
What’s that , Mr O’Rourke ? : 33346.68380757877
Do you know what ? : 229606.1353874252
The Russians , they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese. : 14670.577161254945
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps . : 18393.93197212137
Sad thing about poor Dignam , Mr O’Rourke. : 22998.897629349565
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: : 15852.426129123909
—Good day , Mr O’Rourke. : 44904.827854433475
—Good day to you. : 70198.21991946433
—Lovely weather , sir. : 70200.4807089873
—’Tis all that. : 147721.71540071006
Where do they get the money ? : 44610.24024139602
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim , rinsing empties and old man in the cellar . : 14235.08102605799
Then , lo and behold , they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons . : 16401.93284121446

General thirst . : 147721.71540071006
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub . : 16951.991967070433

Off the drunks perhaps . : 44925.06562279552
Put down three and carry five . : 26973.94709066798

On the wholesale orders perhaps . : 74626.08606720358
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers . : 20287.9053378788
Square it you with the boss and we’ll split the job , see ? : 18318.56700326859
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month ? : 21093.3842083295
Say ten barrels of stuff . : 33362.90043662681
Say he got ten per cent off . : 33143.786989805136
O more . : 316899.7777885344

Slieve Bloom. : 654070.9864952827
He halted before Dlugacz’s window , staring at the hanks of sausages , polonies , black and white . : 12525.502673724359
Fifteen multiplied by . : 70200.4807089873
The figures whitened in his mind , unsolved: displeased , he let them fade . : 16972.04600153844
The shiny links , packed with forcemeat , fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood. : 10814.948575956909
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last . : 38418.03211232349
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter . : 28117.460377928266
Would she buy it too , calling the items from a slip in her hand ? : 13155.355742727375
Chapped: washingsoda . : 147721.71540071006
And a pound and a half of Denny’s sausages . : 28964.606989038075
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips . : 26111.86045534706

He held the page aslant patiently , bending his senses and his will , his soft subject gaze at rest . : 14111.022540506716
The crooked skirt swinging , whack by whack by whack. : 17942.853228184213

—Now , my miss , he said. : 26928.6053485618

His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket. Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles . : 11630.427925528113
They lay , were read quickly and quickly slid , disc by disc , into the till. : 13039.088431772067

Silverpowdered olivetrees . : 147721.71540071006

A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s , clutching a naggin bottle by the neck . : 16190.944936699014
The oldest people . : 65931.0347556799
Wandered far away over all the earth , captivity to captivity , multiplying , dying , being born everywhere . : 11767.692838736844
It lay there now . : 96582.46488614095
Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old woman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world. : 19244.57611579044
Desolation. : 56776224.999992244
Grey horror seared his flesh . : 33362.90043662681
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street , hurrying homeward . : 13662.245702574672
Cold oils slid along his veins , chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak . : 14548.271038829005
Well , I am here now . : 136529.46545215644
Yes , I am here now . : 65753.18565179115
Morning mouth bad images . : 44926.22294796299
Got up wrong side of the bed . : 43637.46080371482
Must begin again those Sandow’s exercises . : 26974.43105546525

Why is that ? : 118075.9328918973
Valuation is only twentyeight . : 44918.14804479664

Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh . : 26972.954244245455
Yes , yes. : 147590.93679863645
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road , swiftly , in slim sandals , along the brightening footpath . : 11768.354686205252
Runs , she runs to meet me , a girl with gold hair on the wind. : 20403.439615925927
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor . : 26135.233199478225
He stooped and gathered them . : 43786.84630843795
Mrs Marion Bloom . : 77710.99973665502
His quickened heart slowed at once . : 62209.39330637088
Bold hand. Mrs Marion. : 70202.74128010684
—Poldy ! : 654070.9864952827
Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head. : 12737.808575468558
—Who are the letters for ? : 51082.617850083305
He looked at them . : 125897.66330468956
Mullingar . : 654070.9864952827
Milly. : 56776224.999992244
—A letter for me from Milly , he said carefully , and a card to you . : 19230.10060817887
And a letter for you. : 225324.924206623
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees. : 13762.033742787899
—Do you want the blind up ? : 26973.934713100607
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow. : 11103.497379787099
—That do ? : 391499.13836868654
he asked , turning. : 145792.5577191024
She was reading the card , propped on her elbow. : 21872.202068622817
—She got the things , she said. : 26923.3789246936
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh. : 12876.645778081598
—Hurry up with that tea , she said . : 36480.75409343039
I’m parched. : 654070.9864952827
—The kettle is boiling , he said. : 26939.888652209385
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat , tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed. : 11903.48315206084
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: : 46564.963028381004
—Poldy ! : 654070.9864952827
—What ? : 654070.9864952827
—Scald the teapot. : 147721.71540071006
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout . : 21694.955982823
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea , tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in . : 12278.192122957309
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle , crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt . : 11570.182608798657
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him . : 29167.754904812864
Give her too much meat she won’t mouse . : 20309.705615667353
Say they won’t eat pork . : 33362.90043662681
Kosher . : 654070.9864952827
Here . : 3806582.195480173
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce . : 12881.487074493456
Pepper. He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup. : 15841.792301644067
Then he slit open his letter , glancing down the page and over . : 21264.782011170704
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s seaside girls. : 14256.659426489667
The tea was drawn . : 42724.59262121199
He filled his own moustachecup , sham crown Derby , smiling . : 30313.57872276093
Silly Milly’s birthday gift . : 44925.06562279552
Only five she was then . : 193727.41259306215
No , wait: four . : 107657.90243336333
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke . : 27288.026369706306
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her . : 19006.937664867426
He smiled , pouring. : 175268.58673136382
O , Milly Bloom , you are my darling. You are my lookingglass from night to morning. I’d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden. : 11740.881270920374
Poor old professor Goodwin . : 74916.63619766088
Dreadful old case . : 145816.03542301815
Still he was a courteous old chap . : 31594.14788689121
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform . : 16961.702345309288
And the little mirror in his silk hat . : 22732.50273449738
The night Milly brought it into the parlour . : 19747.80044627588
O , look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat ! : 16958.765376053114
All we laughed . : 124452.47803310626
Sex breaking out even then . : 60007.5554715242
Pert little piece she was. : 44926.22294796299
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray . : 12521.8365651651
Its hump bumped as he took it up . : 44420.641286856364
Everything on it ? : 87871.99296239502
Bread and butter , four , sugar , spoon , her cream . : 14967.764953630387
Yes . : 654028.8642034819
He carried it upstairs , his thumb hooked in the teapot handle. : 16820.053558155578
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead. : 13616.366715204986
—What a time you were ! : 33346.507315179566
she said. : 3806582.195480173
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly , an elbow on the pillow . : 12710.935065600039
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs , sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder . : 15577.076698291068
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air , mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured. : 13818.934458814401
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow . : 19618.217068476428
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread. : 21972.910878629616
—Who was the letter from ? : 54249.89970210225
he asked. : 2821620.7786225514
Bold hand . : 477931.78174938937
Marion. : 56776224.999992244
—O , Boylan , she said . : 57262.230078670924
He’s bringing the programme. : 70200.4807089873
—What are you singing ? : 44914.6732134283
—_Là ci darem_ with J. C. Doyle , she said , and _Love’s Old Sweet Song_. : 18743.270929408885
Her full lips , drinking , smiled . : 43182.23588750704
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day . : 39917.295264671826
Like foul flowerwater. : 147721.71540071006
—Would you like the window open a little ? : 20303.861245156768
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth , asking: : 16929.032963699134
—What time is the funeral ? : 59972.84103578155
—Eleven , I think , he answered . : 59383.59275381779
I didn’t see the paper. : 42577.20129547616
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed . : 20974.425496066233
No ? : 1851129.1053673674
Then , a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled , shiny sole. : 18327.824922617605
—No: that book. : 147721.71540071006
Other stocking . : 147721.71540071006
Her petticoat. : 1396652.5365386077
—It must have fell down , she said. : 35649.46709683709
He felt here and there . : 55237.04563398549
_Voglio e non vorrei_. Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_. Not in the bed . : 16380.471841451059
Must have slid down . : 44921.621801257075
He stooped and lifted the valance . : 29966.245369425465
The book , fallen , sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot. : 14650.38802675072
—Show here , she said . : 144388.86352152866
I put a mark in it . : 37621.70336469263
There’s a word I wanted to ask you. : 35705.254469075335
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and , having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket , began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word. : 12930.023502233009
—Met him what ? : 70195.95891148868
he asked. : 2821620.7786225514
—Here , she said . : 128879.02978560445
What does that mean ? : 87105.48593927901
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail. : 22047.637567870694
—Metempsychosis ? : 654070.9864952827
—Yes . : 654070.9864952827
Who’s he when he’s at home ? : 26969.114143892435
—Metempsychosis , he said , frowning . : 48800.13566732756
It’s Greek: from the Greek . : 33307.65219418715
That means the transmigration of souls. : 47187.80201555116
—O , rocks ! : 70202.74128010684
she said . : 1545897.07298793
Tell us in plain words. : 44923.908178359256
He smiled , glancing askance at her mocking eyes . : 37718.331930438835

Every word is so deep , Leopold. : 35414.668830201364

Ffoo ! : 654070.9864952827
Well , perhaps it was best for him. : 97413.51375650459
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard . : 14113.840482977477
No use thinking of it any more . : 57213.90237780527
Nosebag time . : 295412.0947273907
Wish I hadn’t met that M’Coy fellow. : 26974.43105546525
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats , the gently champing teeth . : 17161.610222096
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by , amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss . : 13220.366278698259
Their Eldorado . : 265574.21432195127
Poor jugginses ! : 346397.6555345759
Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags . : 13162.915027011953
Too full for words . : 44919.27854958878
Still they get their feed all right and their doss . : 16961.686781675802
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches . : 14973.251772583939
Might be happy all the same that way . : 37280.1297089965
Good poor brutes they look . : 33361.46794437712
Still their neigh can be very irritating. : 26953.651747436757
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried . : 24745.329099232775
Might just walk into her here . : 44606.21339288404
The lane is safer. : 65933.15784360672
He passed the cabman’s shelter . : 37717.93032110977
Curious the life of drifting cabbies. All weathers , all places , time or setdown , no will of their own. _Voglio e non_. Like to give them an odd cigarette . : 10906.808501077585
Sociable . : 654070.9864952827
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass . : 20305.987233041313
He hummed: : 945159.3128138575
Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la. : 18398.888279265087
He turned into Cumberland street and , going on some paces , halted in the lee of the station wall . : 11904.918247114563
No-one . : 654070.9864952827
Meade’s timberyard . : 147721.71540071006
Piled balks. Ruins and tenements . : 33362.90043662681
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone . : 16017.965402173593
Not a sinner . : 276305.7663913684
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles , alone , shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. A wise tabby , a blinking sphinx , watched from her warm sill . : 10044.192990795884
Pity to disturb them . : 53733.322561858535
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her. Open it . : 18241.742361465433

P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use . : 17563.321549762713
I want to know. : 110431.46952733687
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket . : 11932.784494343745
Language of flowers . : 70202.74128010684
They like it because no-one can hear . : 24189.102294486707
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down . : 30048.26708263377
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again , murmuring here and there a word . : 21779.902571352675
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don’t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha’s perfume . : 9795.670752415284
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket. : 19256.767394506915
Weak joy opened his lips . : 97681.45045241935
Changed since the first letter . : 91814.43338815328
Wonder did she wrote it herself . : 53223.936950830495

Then running round corners . : 90879.10446024063
Bad as a row with Molly . : 26960.027244124798

Narcotic. Go further next time . : 47179.76402834944
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words , of course. Brutal , why not ? : 14248.008797214248
Try it anyhow . : 70202.74128010684
A bit at a time. : 74893.5606793999
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it. Common pin , eh ? : 17454.800583703436
He threw it on the road . : 205616.04079459427
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together . : 35643.39386247391
Queer the number of pins they always have . : 39920.558369159626
No roses without thorns. : 118102.74259703777
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head . : 49126.96040356721
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe , linked together in the rain. : 17056.956478128268
O , Mairy lost the pin of her drawers. She didn’t know what to do To keep it up , To keep it up. : 15972.124294928768

He is sitting in their house , talking . : 22032.61104803435
Mysterious. Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen. : 18352.30670427446
To keep it up. : 97706.75994515169
Nice kind of evening feeling . : 33348.63763564018
No more wandering about . : 137780.90958447923
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip . : 20317.500783260028
Forget . : 654070.9864952827
Tell about places you have been , strange customs . : 28348.647598266383
The other one , jar on her head , was getting the supper: fruit , olives , lovely cool water out of a well , stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown . : 11789.411867809366
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches . : 14946.276540596014
She listens with big dark soft eyes . : 35622.58065371973
Tell her: more and more: all . : 38857.104363984225
Then a sigh: silence . : 163072.2135176225
Long long long rest. : 70202.74128010684
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope , tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road . : 15086.395709077935
The shreds fluttered away , sank in the dank air: a white flutter , then all sank. : 12533.2917998081
Henry Flower . : 147721.71540071006
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way . : 37507.95939518285
Simple bit of paper . : 44921.62239027047

Gallons . : 654070.9864952827
About a million barrels all the same. : 44545.43080248352
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head , coach after coach. Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside . : 12653.632296939455

He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full , naked , in a womb of warmth , oiled by scented melting soap , softly laved . : 10979.493354131739
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained , buoyed lightly upward , lemonyellow: his navel , bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating , floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands , a languid floating flower. : 10456.087492281124

All waited . : 316939.94562868436
Then wheels were heard from in front , turning: then nearer: then horses’ hoofs . : 20997.48766587272
A jolt . : 346397.6555345759
Their carriage began to move , creaking and swaying . : 21933.775931901833
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind . : 35722.86196683183
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker , door ajar. At walking pace. : 11876.516524005348
They waited still , their knees jogging , till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks . : 17833.19810672248
Tritonville road . : 477911.2569788051

—That’s a fine old custom , he said . : 37823.2153048975
I am glad to see it has not died out. : 53890.40452092091
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers . : 17857.623356669523
Respect . : 654070.9864952827
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane . : 13971.25887449672
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man , clad in mourning , a wide hat. : 14558.390051700904
—There’s a friend of yours gone by , Dedalus , he said. : 15841.377944587639

—Where is he ? : 133035.02958471712
Mr Dedalus said , stretching over across. : 48030.36183705064
The carriage , passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses , lurched round the corner and , swerving back to the tramtrack , rolled on noisily with chattering wheels . : 10565.250358250649
Mr Dedalus fell back , saying: : 36369.770780485014

O jumping Jupiter ! : 70202.74128010684
Ye gods and little fishes ! : 33362.90043662681
Still , she’s a dear girl . : 26972.94186394419

Yes , yes: a woman too. Life , life. : 20308.609423886755
The carriage heeled over and back , their four trunks swaying. : 16579.453462047484
—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke , Mr Power said. : 19624.553513034825
—He might , Mr Dedalus said , if he hadn’t that squint troubling him . : 15684.52338150324
Do you follow me ? : 153862.73821348939
He closed his left eye . : 37717.12062317854
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs. : 16961.09442996618
—What is this , he said , in the name of God ? : 52343.27985618015
Crumbs ? : 654070.9864952827
—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately , Mr Power said. : 23989.333492507783
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats . : 15161.04273437382
Mr Dedalus , twisting his nose , frowned downward and said: : 17783.307942921423
—Unless I’m greatly mistaken . : 44922.77948133808
What do you think , Martin ? : 80486.18233241916
—It struck me too , Martin Cunningham said. : 22996.216842519258
Mr Bloom set his thigh down . : 29045.79244860128
Glad I took that bath . : 33362.18422894433
Feel my feet quite clean . : 33362.90043662681
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better. : 21834.141928152974
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly. : 79916.93337949764
—After all , he said , it’s the most natural thing in the world. : 22535.829859520367
—Did Tom Kernan turn up ? : 33362.90043662681
Martin Cunningham asked , twirling the peak of his beard gently. : 16936.567079188575
—Yes , Mr Bloom answered . : 54312.60091009246
He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes. : 26974.43105546525
—And Corny Kelleher himself ? : 74922.42692796489
Mr Power asked. : 175586.31393135735
—At the cemetery , Martin Cunningham said. : 26974.43105546525
—I met M’Coy this morning , Mr Bloom said . : 52923.83976161683
He said he’d try to come. : 37713.07082929836
The carriage halted short. : 65931.0347556799
—What’s wrong ? : 147721.71540071006
—We’re stopped. : 654070.9864952827
—Where are we ? : 169359.37187808988
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window. : 24394.75061619917
—The grand canal , he said. : 33313.06199184208
Gasworks . : 654070.9864952827
Whooping cough they say it cures . : 26973.438315931293
Good job Milly never got it . : 30399.89802653114
Poor children ! : 346397.6555345759
Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions . : 20317.210009136208
Shame really . : 147721.71540071006
Got off lightly with illnesses compared . : 26974.43105546525
Only measles . : 477952.30475725327
Flaxseed tea . : 477952.30475725327
Scarlatina , influenza epidemics . : 44926.22294796299
Canvassing for death . : 70202.74128010684
Don’t miss this chance . : 44926.22294796299
Dogs’ home over there . : 71026.39449990107
Poor old Athos ! : 133030.74467174814
Be good to Athos , Leopold , is my last wish . : 28510.504029606254
Thy will be done . : 137527.7745507505
We obey them in the grave. A dying scrawl . : 31750.763819556178
He took it to heart , pined away . : 37405.982996979394
Quiet brute . : 147721.71540071006
Old men’s dogs usually are. : 44926.22294796299
A raindrop spat on his hat . : 38847.75597480361
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags . : 13781.681653716305
Apart . : 654070.9864952827
Curious . : 654070.9864952827
Like through a colander . : 44925.06562279552
I thought it would . : 201336.45832365315
My boots were creaking I remember now. : 34051.76570278954
—The weather is changing , he said quietly. : 29795.94900586156
—A pity it did not keep up fine , Martin Cunningham said. : 24905.998982989007
—Wanted for the country , Mr Power said . : 37080.856626583474
There’s the sun again coming out. : 33362.90043662681
Mr Dedalus , peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun , hurled a mute curse at the sky. : 12381.85869717341
—It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom , he said. : 18375.520847288673
—We’re off again. : 147721.71540071006
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently . : 14684.760360962286
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard. : 18365.603053917705
—Tom Kernan was immense last night , he said . : 43117.131256797744
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face. : 22734.87285281792
—O , draw him out , Martin , Mr Power said eagerly . : 14971.400797234783
Wait till you hear him , Simon , on Ben Dollard’s singing of _The Croppy Boy_. : 16396.852530110165
—Immense , Martin Cunningham said pompously . : 26974.43105546525
_His singing of that simple ballad , Martin , is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience._ : 29909.95475242705
—Trenchant , Mr Power said laughing . : 26974.088582100405
He’s dead nuts on that . : 33352.95848959509
And the retrospective arrangement. : 90575.11215959559
—Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech ? : 44617.58835296125
Martin Cunningham asked. : 147721.71540071006
—I did not then , Mr Dedalus said . : 30008.75086115836
Where is it ? : 211957.93744029355
—In the paper this morning. : 44926.22294796299
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket . : 19372.856571978933
That book I must change for her. : 36290.60917364264
—No , no , Mr Dedalus said quickly . : 26197.484458908108
Later on please. : 147721.71540071006
Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper , scanning the deaths: Callan , Coleman , Dignam , Fawcett , Lowry , Naumann , Peake , what Peake is that ? : 12183.115070917134
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s ? : 24637.051737042977
no , Sexton , Urbright . : 83158.61996765608
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. Thanks to the Little Flower . : 13635.166929006013

It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high. : 11325.077751230509
I tore up the envelope ? : 31899.990185112983
Yes . : 654028.8642034819
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath ? : 21968.57390131606
He patted his waistcoatpocket . : 52053.742711485604
There all right . : 272806.0109704315

Only two there now . : 183821.35729846527
Nodding. Full as a tick . : 33342.11704642411
Too much bone in their skulls . : 26965.50089791892
The other trotting round with a fare . : 34588.51251231121
An hour ago I was passing there . : 30596.68923664414
The jarvies raised their hats. : 42726.73947819277
A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window . : 15445.103092269535
Couldn’t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier ? : 14964.349964618501
Well but that fellow would lose his job then ? : 23756.102734492306
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention ? : 17112.272818832727
Antient concert rooms . : 70202.74128010684
Nothing on there . : 300233.43898096285
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet . : 29435.278219792443
Not much grief there . : 118443.05484100583
Quarter mourning . : 147721.71540071006
People in law perhaps. : 70200.4807089873
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s , under the railway bridge , past the Queen’s theatre: in silence . : 17627.937873819785
Hoardings: Eugene Stratton , Mrs Bandmann Palmer . : 22999.27911751284
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight , I wonder . : 30446.552928493904
I said I. Or the _Lily of Killarney_ ? : 19722.537283497863
Elster Grimes Opera Company . : 44926.22294796299
Big powerful change . : 70200.4807089873

Have to stand a drink or two . : 68536.22240156833

Who was he ? : 235846.71265278984
—How do you do ? : 80589.20246809062
Martin Cunningham said , raising his palm to his brow in salute. : 15842.730842888392
—He doesn’t see us , Mr Power said . : 30042.82533374663
Yes , he does . : 162693.97167949667
How do you do ? : 97567.87264622927
—Who ? : 654070.9864952827
Mr Dedalus asked. : 175586.31393135735
—Blazes Boylan , Mr Power said . : 44616.20079796748
There he is airing his quiff. : 45814.845899214226
Just that moment I was thinking. : 59935.687708831
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute . : 29047.917451335474
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed. : 20201.26502838403
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand , then those of his right hand . : 16121.639929954512
The nails , yes . : 76664.566467128
Is there anything more in him that they she sees ? : 27783.66743121961
Fascination . : 654070.9864952827
Worst man in Dublin . : 44920.492402064236
That keeps him alive . : 137769.9071094351
They sometimes feel what a person is . : 37562.08979165271
Instinct . : 654070.9864952827
But a type like that . : 33107.562568840476
My nails . : 254439.75754879168
I am just looking at them: well pared . : 22605.599516622246
And after: thinking alone . : 111412.06015485042
Body getting a bit softy . : 33362.18422894433
I would notice that: from remembering . : 25958.423951850356
What causes that ? : 90590.07999618577
I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off . : 17230.03313480941
But the shape is there . : 71020.81661100299
The shape is there still . : 31992.661824900053
Shoulders. Hips . : 147721.71540071006
Plump . : 654070.9864952827
Night of the dance dressing . : 59702.26444257664
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind. : 33355.072455199646
He clasped his hands between his knees and , satisfied , sent his vacant glance over their faces. : 12885.930876704619
Mr Power asked: : 175586.31393135735
—How is the concert tour getting on , Bloom ? : 18387.777222334596
—O , very well , Mr Bloom said . : 61483.15916056176
I hear great accounts of it . : 31496.513167537974
It’s a good idea , you see... : 26950.597189383865
—Are you going yourself ? : 90879.10446024063
—Well no , Mr Bloom said . : 44609.630584041806
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business . : 21710.406234663427
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns . : 18977.681622718734
What you lose on one you can make up on the other. : 23128.646712910755
—Quite so , Martin Cunningham said . : 44603.66345372813
Mary Anderson is up there now. : 51088.103041361486
Have you good artists ? : 127452.23115918627
—Louis Werner is touring her , Mr Bloom said . : 37193.368863417854
O yes , we’ll have all topnobbers . : 22997.662603773075
J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and . : 26162.04183123995
The best , in fact. : 86266.87375787913
—And _Madame_ , Mr Power said smiling . : 35723.04027078515
Last but not least. : 169315.7293175114
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them . : 15003.438070815855
Smith O’Brien . : 147721.71540071006
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman . : 18398.651294802596
Must be his deathday . : 44918.11916617765
For many happy returns . : 74914.70630231591
The carriage wheeling by Farrell’s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees. : 16581.77905230951
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares , his mouth opening: oot. : 13152.402835395864
—Four bootlaces for a penny. : 44900.25827610144
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls . : 20294.97001492627
Had his office in Hume street. Same house as Molly’s namesake , Tweedy , crown solicitor for Waterford. Has that silk hat ever since . : 13380.798601471244
Relics of old decency . : 44925.06562279552
Mourning too. Terrible comedown , poor wretch ! : 22999.514245861126
Kicked about like snuff at a wake. O’Callaghan on his last legs. : 15848.339525623474
And _Madame_. Twenty past eleven . : 39539.72755747993
Up . : 654070.9864952827
Mrs Fleming is in to clean . : 28583.853520873
Doing her hair , humming: _voglio e non vorrei_. No: _vorrei e non_. Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split . : 11936.130300829484
_Mi trema un poco il_. Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone . : 13661.784510167887
A thrush . : 346397.6555345759
A throstle . : 346397.6555345759
There is a word throstle that expresses that. : 53456.53597002848
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face . : 28975.809089709495
Greyish over the ears . : 44914.6732134283
_Madame_: smiling . : 477952.30475725327
I smiled back . : 65663.82622679525
A smile goes a long way. Only politeness perhaps . : 23757.933470676217
Nice fellow . : 147721.71540071006
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps ? : 20886.33333921748
Not pleasant for the wife . : 91690.75288132759
Yet they say , who was it told me , there is no carnal . : 34134.29033122312
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick . : 18982.444264908165
Yes , it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak . : 13551.157485683985
What is this she was ? : 64233.35845171877
Barmaid in Jury’s . : 70202.74128010684
Or the Moira , was it ? : 30617.889087337884
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator’s form. : 28573.109248208864
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power. : 44926.22294796299
—Of the tribe of Reuben , he said. : 22973.741437323635
A tall blackbearded figure , bent on a stick , stumping round the corner of Elvery’s Elephant house , showed them a curved hand open on his spine. : 11351.536171624797
—In all his pristine beauty , Mr Power said. : 20308.282692993515
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: : 19371.930966747303
—The devil break the hasp of your back ! : 20302.715640642284
Mr Power , collapsing in laughter , shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray’s statue. : 17044.128653905438
—We have all been there , Martin Cunningham said broadly. : 18395.34385819794
His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes . : 51605.67290513729
He caressed his beard , adding: : 37718.74003642331
—Well , nearly all of us. : 33357.90323959083
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces. : 26381.913799820504
—That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son. : 13649.539902580591
—About the boatman ? : 70202.74128010684
Mr Power asked. : 175586.31393135735
—Yes . : 654070.9864952827
Isn’t it awfully good ? : 90881.44561819625
—What is that ? : 70193.69768501108
Mr Dedalus asked . : 79916.93337949764
I didn’t hear it. : 65668.05553403238
—There was a girl in the case , Mr Bloom began , and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were both..... : 16576.325794965564
—What ? : 654070.9864952827
Mr Dedalus asked . : 79916.93337949764
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it ? : 41276.708767478005
—Yes , Mr Bloom said . : 60010.53164621862
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown..... : 27734.310926819027
—Drown Barabbas ! : 147721.71540071006
Mr Dedalus cried . : 79911.97647744791
I wish to Christ he did ! : 71005.71589854204
Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils. : 19376.8589177965
—No , Mr Bloom said , the son himself..... : 29989.376207077003
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: : 33361.46794437712
—Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey. : 14855.854040118027
—For God’s sake ! : 70202.74128010684
Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright . : 36373.65633906889
Is he dead ? : 113090.48006915707
—Dead ! : 654070.9864952827
Martin Cunningham cried . : 70198.38690741721
Not he ! : 346412.9031654586
A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive . : 13983.28920904479
Half the town was there. : 44920.49287441462
—Yes , Mr Bloom said . : 60010.53164621862
But the funny part is..... : 70370.9514059396
—And Reuben J , Martin Cunningham said , gave the boatman a florin for saving his son’s life. : 15044.88352767305
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand. : 26991.592191880693
—O , he did , Martin Cunningham affirmed . : 26174.721185512943
Like a hero . : 70202.74128010684
A silver florin. : 346397.6555345759
—Isn’t it awfully good ? : 90881.44561819625
Mr Bloom said eagerly. : 79916.93337949764
—One and eightpence too much , Mr Dedalus said drily. : 23751.055705258557
Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage. : 31750.712261197445
Nelson’s pillar. : 654070.9864952827
—Eight plums a penny ! : 44926.22294796299
Eight for a penny ! : 44900.25827610144
—We had better look a little serious , Martin Cunningham said. : 16955.55298899588
Mr Dedalus sighed. : 175586.31393135735
—Ah then indeed , he said , poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh. Many a good one he told himself. : 16020.762516804305
—The Lord forgive me ! : 62266.028267423724
Mr Power said , wiping his wet eyes with his fingers . : 16548.632125848686
Poor Paddy ! : 346397.6555345759
I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this. He’s gone from us. : 14638.575864643526
—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat , Mr Dedalus said . : 17272.938531302843
He went very suddenly. : 84390.61216777567
—Breakdown , Martin Cunningham said . : 60010.13227348695
Heart. : 56776224.999992244
He tapped his chest sadly. : 52053.742711485604
Blazing face: redhot . : 70202.74128010684
Too much John Barleycorn . : 44926.22294796299
Cure for a red nose. Drink like the devil till it turns adelite . : 14253.322774306387
A lot of money he spent colouring it. : 31657.94148763243
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension. : 19364.290405334585
—He had a sudden death , poor fellow , he said. : 16945.690343030885
—The best death , Mr Bloom said. : 44616.20079796748
Their wide open eyes looked at him. : 34678.28724720905
—No suffering , he said . : 84750.57670944849
A moment and all is over . : 58990.54863061154
Like dying in sleep. : 70202.74128010684
No-one spoke. : 654070.9864952827
Dead side of the street this . : 56069.25119799531
Dull business by day , land agents , temperance hotel , Falconer’s railway guide , civil service college , Gill’s , catholic club , the industrious blind . : 10357.633419523132

—Poor little thing , Mr Dedalus said . : 35715.58771254599
It’s well out of it. : 44908.40222363338
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square . : 16581.58488908138
Rattle his bones . : 70202.74128010684
Over the stones . : 70202.74128010684
Only a pauper . : 169359.37187808988
Nobody owns. : 654070.9864952827
—In the midst of life , Martin Cunningham said. : 30043.97429876389
—But the worst of all , Mr Power said , is the man who takes his own life. : 37415.16044435759
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly , coughed and put it back. : 14972.66570563963
—The greatest disgrace to have in the family , Mr Power added. : 22937.399593976625
—Temporary insanity , of course , Martin Cunningham said decisively . : 24748.596377520527
We must take a charitable view of it. : 31654.44864558222
—They say a man who does it is a coward , Mr Dedalus said. : 20360.957372734294
—It is not for us to judge , Martin Cunningham said. : 38434.76176495989
Mr Bloom , about to speak , closed his lips again . : 31488.93986343392
Martin Cunningham’s large eyes . : 90869.73741516516
Looking away now . : 169343.67603409628
Sympathetic human man he is . : 107857.8086841859
Intelligent. Like Shakespeare’s face . : 90879.10446024063
Always a good word to say . : 61840.43559952225
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide . : 19148.729113257057
Refuse christian burial . : 70202.74128010684
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave . : 17028.841279894892
As if it wasn’t broken already . : 31202.80522067339
Yet sometimes they repent too late . : 40957.063599152134
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes . : 26885.750283861005
He looked at me . : 188850.78504222

Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost . : 12046.810827505748

He looked away from me . : 169062.39005532692
He knows . : 188796.4406417153

Wake no more . : 209234.64474223813
Nobody owns. : 654070.9864952827
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street . : 34617.856115947354
Over the stones. : 147721.71540071006
—We are going the pace , I think , Martin Cunningham said. : 23404.741961464784
—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road , Mr Power said. : 22345.01113060655
—I hope not , Martin Cunningham said . : 35715.43940039074
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany . : 57748.656216607975
The Gordon Bennett. : 135865.98758199185
—Yes , by Jove , Mr Dedalus said . : 30026.32269925901
That will be worth seeing , faith. : 59992.11517439205
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls . : 12863.971748040232
Has anybody here seen Kelly ? : 54309.90746998159

Then the screen round her bed for her to die . : 28204.801880449893
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me . : 18745.336691160177

From one extreme to the other. : 47017.763936844385
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped. : 26023.92283187325
—What’s wrong now ? : 70202.74128010684
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows , lowing , slouching by on padded hoofs , whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups . : 14603.482573428739
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear. : 16964.270943701973
—Emigrants , Mr Power said. : 44926.58173378085
—Huuuh ! : 654070.9864952827
the drover’s voice cried , his switch sounding on their flanks. Huuuh ! : 18220.28195185047
out of that ! : 70116.13642977267

Comes to a big thing in a year . : 20281.105056544835
Dead meat trade . : 70202.74128010684

Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla. : 14255.350796762948
The carriage moved on through the drove. : 26018.7355745217
—I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays , Mr Bloom said . : 13250.151150091457
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats. : 19143.106937969722
—Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare , Martin Cunningham said . : 23363.53426593647
Quite right . : 477890.7304451221
They ought to. : 169034.9074792272
—Yes , Mr Bloom said , and another thing I often thought , is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan , you know . : 18446.13671648943
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams , hearse and carriage and all . : 13770.975144024675
Don’t you see what I mean ? : 37392.50933275351

Pullman car and saloon diningroom. : 44926.22294796299
—A poor lookout for Corny , Mr Power added. : 20317.590926335102
—Why ? : 654070.9864952827
Mr Bloom asked , turning to Mr Dedalus . : 47077.550075498846
Wouldn’t it be more decent than galloping two abreast ? : 18395.1070120381
—Well , there’s something in that , Mr Dedalus granted. : 18389.03538604101
—And , Martin Cunningham said , we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road. : 10608.527305700121
—That was terrible , Mr Power’s shocked face said , and the corpse fell about the road . : 20159.07413883887
Terrible ! : 654070.9864952827
—First round Dunphy’s , Mr Dedalus said , nodding . : 18394.90056943364

Red face: grey now . : 90872.36642171186
Mouth fallen open . : 70200.4807089873
Asking what’s up now . : 90872.36642171186
Quite right to close it . : 68977.09829542722
Looks horrid open . : 70200.4807089873
Then the insides decompose quickly . : 60011.420715940854
Much better to close up all the orifices . : 44388.56646547094
Yes , also. With wax . : 33348.12901464862
The sphincter loose . : 65933.15784360672

Expect we’ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health . : 14245.30898010306
Pass round the consolation. Elixir of life. : 26970.980279067302
But suppose now it did happen . : 26796.455758504824
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about ? : 16137.168722965178
He would and he wouldn’t , I suppose . : 24491.421635058818
Depends on where . : 70202.74128010684
The circulation stops . : 65933.15784360672
Still some might ooze out of an artery. It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red. : 18120.07251328606
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road . : 59479.63395581894
An empty hearse trotted by , coming from the cemetery: looks relieved. : 15841.792301644067

Their eyes watched him . : 81781.12841366562
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds , over slime , mudchoked bottles , carrion dogs . : 11427.019234815114
Athlone , Mullingar , Moyvalley , I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal . : 16167.929171060665
Or cycle down . : 70193.7540741031
Hire some old crock , safety . : 26974.43105546525

Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men , old women , children , women dead in childbirth , men with beards , baldheaded businessmen , consumptive girls with little sparrows’ breasts . : 10462.564075939123
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep . : 12850.439866180957
On Dignam now. : 278958.9574717852
_—In paradisum._ : 654070.9864952827
Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise . : 28745.779619471276
Says that over everybody . : 44926.22294796299
Tiresome kind of a job . : 59897.46939230662
But he has to say something. : 33073.55689399511
The priest closed his book and went off , followed by the server . : 17993.757211414402
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in , hoisted the coffin again , carried it out and shoved it on their cart . : 11709.423587678553
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law . : 18277.243663839978
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air . : 19469.56724866657
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket . : 16554.69268824508
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left . : 14320.719905618638
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres. : 10510.629921196127
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo . : 16581.973217811206
Lord , I mustn’t lilt here. : 97565.81155777983
—The O’Connell circle , Mr Dedalus said about him. : 20317.3001509212
Mr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone. : 25479.882751540466
—He’s at rest , he said , in the middle of his people , old Dan O’. But his heart is buried in Rome . : 18533.445306712634
How many broken hearts are buried here , Simon ! : 20241.09868372321
—Her grave is over there , Jack , Mr Dedalus said . : 21261.340667362463
I’ll soon be stretched beside her . : 29751.302652475235
Let Him take me whenever He likes. : 37415.71873809518
Breaking down , he began to weep to himself quietly , stumbling a little in his walk . : 22223.787461132924
Mr Power took his arm. : 49830.37230314805
—She’s better where she is , he said kindly. : 25559.50120377882
—I suppose so , Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp . : 21248.62171820729
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven. : 28053.759622002504
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by. : 14254.55938813056
—Sad occasions , Mr Kernan began politely. : 26972.61159936949
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head. : 17781.64678449652
—The others are putting on their hats , Mr Kernan said . : 21262.69978295003
I suppose we can do so too . : 22235.17012624578
We are the last . : 271749.7502563362
This cemetery is a treacherous place. : 42198.89017222972
They covered their heads. : 77669.96587430409
—The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly , don’t you think ? : 25740.54254297791
Mr Kernan said with reproof. : 49832.9402162292
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes . : 24443.124585729925
Secret eyes , secretsearching . : 44920.46400182496
Mason , I think: not sure . : 26942.606452103177
Beside him again . : 214219.88158065395
We are the last . : 271749.7502563362
In the same boat . : 79298.81978377965
Hope he’ll say something else. : 90867.39655881956
Mr Kernan added: : 175586.31393135735
—The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler , more impressive I must say. : 12348.77249108289
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent . : 36373.65633906889
The language of course was another thing. : 43027.32728518921
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: : 49832.9402162292
—_I am the resurrection and the life_. That touches a man’s inmost heart. : 14955.562652003915
—It does , Mr Bloom said. : 33362.40625722764
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies ? : 12989.21283432227
No touching that . : 118087.52847057671
Seat of the affections. Broken heart . : 44415.61234495875
A pump after all , pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day . : 25527.668052165493
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are . : 28503.152383259636
Lots of them lying around here: lungs , hearts , livers . : 15851.43022615994
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else . : 55475.8608221883
The resurrection and the life . : 51948.430003693225
Once you are dead you are dead . : 22968.590497326233
That last day idea . : 68094.47989617565
Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come forth , Lazarus ! : 18733.48525841571
And he came fifth and lost the job . : 22750.680309091014
Get up ! : 147721.71540071006
Last day ! : 1546476.8546701153
Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps . : 22576.090341936426
Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder in a skull . : 14245.216225633912
Twelve grammes one pennyweight . : 44926.22294796299
Troy measure. : 654070.9864952827
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side. : 22996.55099328895
—Everything went off A1 , he said . : 46277.6175643138
What ? : 1089125.7589536693
He looked on them from his drawling eye . : 32599.56651891493
Policeman’s shoulders . : 147721.71540071006
With your tooraloom tooraloom. : 105550.31748660652
—As it should be , Mr Kernan said. : 29166.810554515865
—What ? : 654070.9864952827
Eh ? : 654070.9864952827
Corny Kelleher said. : 147721.71540071006
Mr Kernan assured him. : 79916.93337949764
—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan ? : 20316.337486958593
John Henry Menton asked . : 44926.22294796299
I know his face. : 136306.696150301
Ned Lambert glanced back. : 70202.74128010684
—Bloom , he said , Madame Marion Tweedy that was , is , I mean , the soprano . : 20106.95058113094
She’s his wife. : 147721.71540071006
—O , to be sure , John Henry Menton said . : 32405.828320154815
I haven’t seen her for some time . : 80432.6027026052
She was a finelooking woman . : 80009.49737123822
I danced with her , wait , fifteen seventeen golden years ago , at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown . : 14616.754754023666
And a good armful she was. : 71099.31516245926
He looked behind through the others. : 67829.24101107722
—What is he ? : 133035.02958471712
he asked . : 391415.51316403976
What does he do ? : 98862.29085920594
Wasn’t he in the stationery line ? : 26885.750283861005
I fell foul of him one evening , I remember , at bowls. : 24057.21485286191
Ned Lambert smiled. : 147721.71540071006
—Yes , he was , he said , in Wisdom Hely’s . : 49890.21391405591
A traveller for blottingpaper. : 133030.74467174814
—In God’s name , John Henry Menton said , what did she marry a coon like that for ? : 19973.229462005143
She had plenty of game in her then. : 28091.83381099401
—Has still , Ned Lambert said . : 44615.12533796698
He does some canvassing for ads. : 37717.95051340359
John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead. : 26974.43105546525
The barrow turned into a side lane . : 22284.844984206153
A portly man , ambushed among the grasses , raised his hat in homage . : 16199.458357387139
The gravediggers touched their caps. : 42726.73947819277
—John O’Connell , Mr Power said pleased . : 33146.62167273853
He never forgets a friend. : 52052.401777337385
Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence . : 41204.09413032774
Mr Dedalus said: : 175586.31393135735
—I am come to pay you another visit. : 22992.909644781314
—My dear Simon , the caretaker answered in a low voice . : 31779.930099729056
I don’t want your custom at all. : 25964.079041820925
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back. : 11525.115926716508
—Did you hear that one , he asked them , about Mulcahy from the Coombe ? : 15777.696797357285
—I did not , Martin Cunningham said. : 26931.173120615967
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear . : 20253.79174296866
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles. : 13087.135603250339
—They tell the story , he said , that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs . : 19025.894852824124
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried . : 17727.470907932136
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough . : 26410.999946312426
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy . : 23301.076796617588
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up. : 12200.329986240335
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed . : 39892.4918579599
He resumed: : 945159.3128138575
—And , after blinking up at the sacred figure , _Not a bloody bit like the man_ , says he . : 11520.670662485694
_That’s not Mulcahy_ , says he , _whoever done it_. : 18396.175951958994
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher , accepting the dockets given him , turning them over and scanning them as he walked. : 11943.852963621104
—That’s all done with a purpose , Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes. : 15844.43373407725
—I know , Hynes said . : 59988.40507282882
I know that. : 357833.07671709266
—To cheer a fellow up , Martin Cunningham said . : 26163.837488735022
It’s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else. : 26974.43105546525
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk . : 24538.84069472565
All want to be on good terms with him . : 159502.7725505118
Decent fellow , John O’Connell , real good sort. Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out . : 16250.672547537675
No passout checks . : 118102.74259703777
_Habeas corpus_. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha ? : 10140.503549415671
Hope it’s not chucked in the dead letter office . : 26107.936924222613
Be the better of a shave . : 40898.73809586571
Grey sprouting beard . : 70202.74128010684
That’s the first sign when the hairs come out grey . : 16954.005757146475
And temper getting cross. Silver threads among the grey . : 20371.618260912775
Fancy being his wife . : 371720.41414418846
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl . : 21379.6182645443
Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her . : 38451.42973658315
It might thrill her first . : 113556.6996892376
Courting death. Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about . : 20774.351353659647
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark . : 10277.614184030463
Will o’ the wisp . : 90879.10446024063
Gas of graves . : 70202.74128010684
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all . : 21129.096383893357
Women especially are so touchy . : 33360.75158290701
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep . : 17074.40993544593
Have you ever seen a ghost ? : 56798.241585858115
Well , I have . : 1136386.3987201995
It was a pitchdark night . : 56238.410071046615
The clock was on the stroke of twelve . : 25457.987861086094
Still they’d kiss all right if properly keyed up . : 26166.83932987747
Whores in Turkish graveyards. Learn anything if taken young . : 18398.651294802596
You might pick up a young widow here. Men like that . : 17575.773016732597
Love among the tombstones . : 44920.43512916107
Romeo . : 654070.9864952827
Spice of pleasure . : 300166.20040521596
In the midst of death we are in life . : 42291.69984116587
Both ends meet . : 145820.6138419473
Tantalising for the poor dead . : 33285.98884199277
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving . : 22936.58030188915
Gnawing their vitals . : 70202.74128010684
Desire to grig people . : 44925.06562279552
Molly wanting to do it at the window. Eight children he has anyway. : 17321.831045390074
He has seen a fair share go under in his time , lying around him field after field . : 18142.82106886007
Holy fields . : 147721.71540071006
More room if they buried them standing. Sitting or kneeling you couldn’t . : 14972.36860814494
Standing ? : 654070.9864952827
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing . : 13516.366247012842
All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells . : 26203.7031223968
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings . : 17260.70239432888
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome . : 26124.384588397603
Well , so it is . : 695771.32595006
Ought to be flowers of sleep . : 26854.03794871045
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me . : 17562.29620415868
The Botanic Gardens are just over there . : 29676.41854097504
It’s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life . : 22081.908245864543
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every man his price . : 13663.295899963334
Well preserved fat corpse , gentleman , epicure , invaluable for fruit garden . : 17112.7490689364
A bargain . : 346397.6555345759
By carcass of William Wilkinson , auditor and accountant , lately deceased , three pounds thirteen and six . : 13598.30127945699
With thanks. : 1478549.3724650557
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure , bones , flesh , nails . : 15419.838190300798
Charnelhouses . : 654070.9864952827
Dreadful . : 654070.9864952827
Turning green and pink decomposing . : 33362.90043662681
Rot quick in damp earth . : 33362.18422894433
The lean old ones tougher . : 31996.09689368749
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy . : 44244.4234926355
Then begin to get black , black treacle oozing out of them . : 23440.53341549388
Then dried up . : 408528.5688832987
Deathmoths . : 654070.9864952827
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living . : 28512.92677847605
Changing about . : 477952.81650091853
Live for ever practically. Nothing to feed on feed on themselves. : 16963.917276684708
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots . : 28387.523155366725
Soil must be simply swirling with them . : 32616.45122545702
Your head it simply swurls . : 51089.199782858705
Those pretty little seaside gurls . : 33362.90043662681
He looks cheerful enough over it . : 33769.7921137637
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first . : 26390.810458696687
Wonder how he looks at life . : 40949.58054012313
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart . : 39695.67546027572
The one about the bulletin . : 31984.47951618347
Spurgeon went to heaven <NUM> a.m . : 26969.51509023931
this morning . : 1037038.4139538615
<NUM> p.m . : 147721.71540071006
( closing time ) . Not arrived yet . : 20315.202448081694
Peter . : 654070.9864952827
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s in fashion . : 14977.41272464582
A juicy pear or ladies’ punch , hot , strong and sweet . : 18227.29722424603
Keep out the damp . : 44920.43512916107
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way. Gravediggers in _Hamlet_. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart . : 18786.401038435928
Daren’t joke about the dead for two years at least . : 30466.99021215872
_De mortuis nil nisi prius_. Go out of mourning first . : 23362.607226495304
Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke . : 33396.74939218893
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer . : 16960.5096828608
Gives you second wind . : 90881.44561819625
New lease of life. : 70202.74128010684
—How many have you for tomorrow ? : 26966.027339842887
the caretaker asked. : 346397.6555345759
—Two , Corny Kelleher said . : 60010.13227348695
Half ten and eleven. : 70202.74128010684
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket . : 19742.380641122578
The barrow had ceased to trundle . : 26023.92283187325
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole , stepping with care round the graves . : 12940.698293805011
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink , looping the bands round it. : 14831.603683747788
Burying him . : 223021.82824419474
We come to bury Cæsar . : 51073.971170291115
His ides of March or June . : 31201.510688684815
He doesn’t know who is here nor care . : 30507.58315212438
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh ? : 27075.477573613774
Now who is he I’d like to know ? : 44423.85538412601
Now I’d give a trifle to know who he is . : 44304.97257459034
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of . : 30047.836550508047
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life . : 50130.148077976446
Yes , he could . : 590408.4822232473
Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave . : 13620.628455710663
We all do . : 773972.5285146037
Only man buries . : 169359.37187808988
No , ants too. First thing strikes anybody . : 33015.886425938435
Bury the dead . : 70198.21991946433
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life . : 33143.27888707512
Well then Friday buried him . : 62776.87980859587
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it. : 22985.716415649982
O , poor Robinson Crusoe ! : 33362.90043662681
How could you possibly do so ? : 113865.55706805784
Poor Dignam ! : 346397.6555345759
His last lie on the earth in his box . : 20339.981744020268
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood . : 21692.34328681303
All gnawed through . : 124448.47058735036
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding , let it down that way . : 23791.44297497221
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s. They’re so particular . : 13135.448374308566
Lay me in my native earth . : 26960.221289189933
Bit of clay from the holy land . : 22970.573462641518
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin . : 24539.1227303966
I see what it means . : 103212.32129725665
I see . : 135085.86872240287
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth . : 37792.04879055257
The Irishman’s house is his coffin . : 26022.964950492384
Embalming in catacombs , mummies the same idea. : 22984.888383430894
Mr Bloom stood far back , his hat in his hand , counting the bared heads. Twelve . : 18820.968629125902
I’m thirteen . : 147721.71540071006
No . : 1851009.8923125966
The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death’s number . : 17901.540760758857
Where the deuce did he pop out of ? : 41573.1539064539
He wasn’t in the chapel , that I’ll swear . : 19740.483829891833
Silly superstition that about thirteen. : 44926.22294796299
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit . : 26163.15309897438
Tinge of purple . : 70202.74128010684
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west . : 18359.897473499102
Dressy fellow he was once . : 54219.59081124236
Used to change three suits in the day . : 38646.94068231672
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias . : 16964.66823466252
Hello . : 654070.9864952827
It’s dyed . : 147721.71540071006
His wife I forgot he’s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him. : 14184.736874970267
The coffin dived out of sight , eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles . : 17646.849867642482
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered . : 21245.37830389451
Twenty. : 56776224.999992244
Pause. : 56776224.999992244
If we were all suddenly somebody else. : 47354.53103136926
Far away a donkey brayed . : 60011.420715940854
Rain . : 654070.9864952827
No such ass . : 118102.74259703777
Never see a dead one , they say . : 44413.87809743569
Shame of death . : 70202.74128010684
They hide . : 169034.9074792272
Also poor papa went away. : 44926.22294796299
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper . : 19603.209901927938
Whisper . : 654070.9864952827
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space . : 14293.74949781467
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker . : 21521.853191474733
Wellcut frockcoat . : 147721.71540071006
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next . : 16957.726673666286
Well , it is a long rest . : 150190.7431035174
Feel no more . : 209234.64474223813
It’s the moment you feel . : 33359.37209328507
Must be damned unpleasant . : 44926.22294796299
Can’t believe it at first . : 165228.27288259505
Mistake must be: someone else . : 60006.2661160036
Try the house opposite . : 44906.33320561013
Wait , I wanted to . : 54223.48227518674
I haven’t yet . : 65668.05553403238
Then darkened deathchamber . : 169359.37187808988
Light they want . : 70200.4807089873
Whispering around you . : 118055.21532437697
Would you like to see a priest ? : 70832.66586825237
Then rambling and wandering . : 90879.10446024063
Delirium all you hid all your life . : 33140.0766012073
The death struggle . : 65931.0347556799
His sleep is not natural . : 39506.10925974646
Press his lower eyelid . : 44926.22294796299
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow . : 12724.718785519115
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed . : 13654.872980274335
Devil in that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman . : 21254.453570517922
Dying to embrace her in his shirt . : 22972.944693142275
Last act of _Lucia . : 90876.76336259459
Shall I nevermore behold thee_ ? : 60011.420715940854
Bam ! : 654070.9864952827
He expires . : 188812.65427145068
Gone at last . : 258348.2578080276
People talk about you a bit: forget you. Don’t forget to pray for him . : 16682.166765173297
Remember him in your prayers . : 33335.17618114284
Even Parnell . : 477952.30475725327
Ivy day dying out . : 90867.56806414874
Then they follow: dropping into a hole , one after the other. : 21257.148011992474
We are praying now for the repose of his soul . : 21341.16655617271
Hoping you’re well and not in hell . : 22989.592075928416
Nice change of air . : 44920.46459461777
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory. : 16908.88707266326
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself ? : 38344.012447319736
They say you do when you shiver in the sun . : 17558.337955986848
Someone walking over it . : 53107.32004548792
Callboy’s warning. Near you . : 68090.22879100885
Mine over there towards Finglas , the plot I bought . : 16939.98499027429
Mamma , poor mamma , and little Rudy. : 35431.94848923938
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin . : 12545.434335955091
Mr Bloom turned away his face . : 48039.38760305191
And if he was alive all the time ? : 46440.343414421266
Whew ! : 654070.9864952827
By jingo , that would be awful ! : 44034.97442688545
No , no: he is dead , of course . : 61344.3403605829
Of course he is dead . : 107860.07053522494
Monday he died . : 70200.4807089873
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole . : 14710.968581760682
Flag of distress . : 70198.22021065954
Three days . : 1266692.0025008935
Rather long to keep them in summer . : 30611.400092379718
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no. : 22959.471644238107
The clay fell softer . : 42726.73947819277
Begin to be forgotten . : 369549.4170761312
Out of sight , out of mind. : 44600.86243238389
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat . : 19249.17864600773
Had enough of it . : 86212.31051612514
The mourners took heart of grace , one by one , covering themselves without show . : 12957.216523677671
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves . : 16519.020655927176
Quietly , sure of his ground , he traversed the dismal fields. : 15817.6662207147
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook . : 22977.361711508907
Ah , the names . : 90590.79214485685
But he knows them all . : 77601.00426996582
No: coming to me. : 70182.61301502357
—I am just taking the names , Hynes said below his breath . : 14972.509898415034
What is your christian name ? : 208216.9927484693
I’m not sure. : 147721.71540071006
—L , Mr Bloom said . : 60010.53164621862
Leopold . : 654070.9864952827
And you might put down M’Coy’s name too . : 22750.363918239935
He asked me to. : 84390.61216777567
—Charley , Hynes said writing . : 33362.18422894433
I know . : 1157469.870762322
He was on the _Freeman_ once. : 151871.19725621986
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne . : 21804.475677987113
Good idea a postmortem for doctors . : 26974.43105546525
Find out what they imagine they know . : 35714.33134047404
He died of a Tuesday . : 37658.36857466967
Got the run . : 70202.74128010684
Levanted with the cash of a few ads. Charley , you’re my darling . : 17538.316116702936
That was why he asked me to . : 42963.89780760852
O well , does no harm . : 26967.63937242946
I saw to that , M’Coy . : 25946.90311390707
Thanks , old chap: much obliged . : 26972.94205576996
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing. : 26974.43105546525
—And tell us , Hynes said , do you know that fellow in the , fellow was over there in the... : 20307.63849794987
He looked around. : 610875.4425712018
—Macintosh . : 654070.9864952827
Yes , I saw him , Mr Bloom said . : 70785.00640231119
Where is he now ? : 90872.08104666161
—M’Intosh , Hynes said scribbling . : 33362.90043662681
I don’t know who he is . : 70981.74557608188
Is that his name ? : 132986.9526229828
He moved away , looking about him. : 29952.584768128203
—No , Mr Bloom began , turning and stopping . : 18397.77672826805
I say , Hynes ! : 42563.138148326565
Didn’t hear . : 147696.6568557595
What ? : 1089125.7589536693
Where has he disappeared to ? : 107947.68686701219
Not a sign . : 276305.7663913684
Well of all the . : 95721.79389488253
Has anybody here seen ? : 80619.15170985038
Kay ee double ell . : 44926.22294796299
Become invisible . : 147721.71540071006
Good Lord , what became of him ? : 40903.2668124504
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade. : 18224.78890974748
—O , excuse me ! : 62266.028267423724
He stepped aside nimbly. : 84390.61216777567
Clay , brown , damp , began to be seen in the hole . : 26502.54098423166
It rose . : 163514.0544850091
Nearly over. A mound of damp clods rose more , rose , and the gravediggers rested their spades . : 13471.464635663591
All uncovered again for a few instants . : 36530.39756850174
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump . : 13435.079722473785
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow . : 13433.945357157098
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean . : 26144.66747373292
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass . : 19617.968772124073
One , leaving his mates , walked slowly on with shouldered weapon , its blade blueglancing. Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband . : 12393.987634093013
His navelcord. The brother-in-law , turning away , placed something in his free hand. Thanks in silence . : 22021.76348858315
Sorry , sir: trouble . : 44925.06562279552
Headshake . : 654070.9864952827
I know that . : 328652.6943738662
For yourselves just. : 346397.6555345759
The mourners moved away slowly without aim , by devious paths , staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb. : 11172.895692345193
—Let us go round by the chief’s grave , Hynes said . : 21245.054487662852
We have time. : 1120528.2875670514
—Let us , Mr Power said. : 33351.70720939395
They turned to the right , following their slow thoughts . : 33322.42468119162
With awe Mr Power’s blank voice spoke: : 34053.00332751269
—Some say he is not in that grave at all . : 41662.64102962938
That the coffin was filled with stones . : 46331.64283225643
That one day he will come again. : 36295.32110678419
Hynes shook his head. : 70198.33175338316
—Parnell will never come again , he said . : 55917.628519131504
He’s there , all that was mortal of him . : 42908.187677764465
Peace to his ashes. : 70079.54403371926
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels , crosses , broken pillars , family vaults , stone hopes praying with upcast eyes , old Ireland’s hearts and hands . : 11299.888264219022
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living . : 23871.6550620554
Pray for the repose of the soul of . : 44224.22914249999
Does anybody really ? : 145811.2223627505
Plant him and have done with him . : 55468.80352104091
Like down a coalshoot . : 44926.22294796299
Then lump them together to save time . : 46322.73992128555
All souls’ day. Twentyseventh I’ll be at his grave . : 23127.214752341388
Ten shillings for the gardener . : 54188.16802180295
He keeps it free of weeds . : 29966.245369425465
Old man himself . : 118080.47465021726
Bent down double with his shears clipping . : 22992.118768742806
Near death’s door . : 145811.2223627505
Who passed away . : 409101.9348105994
Who departed this life . : 127442.37413127768
As if they did it of their own accord . : 20351.021740032265
Got the shove , all of them . : 63730.98030441487
Who kicked the bucket . : 71028.22492896486
More interesting if they told you what they were . : 43113.858019902
So and So , wheelwright . : 60007.5554715242
I travelled for cork lino . : 31910.273272339433
I paid five shillings in the pound . : 22179.939039585566
Or a woman’s with her saucepan . : 26959.544548918526
I cooked good Irish stew . : 31910.273272339433
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell . : 14754.722829514974
Entered into rest the protestants put it . : 25534.5310920435
Old Dr Murren’s . : 70202.74128010684
The great physician called him home . : 36092.61844519467
Well it’s God’s acre for them . : 67061.40830857994
Nice country residence . : 70200.4807089873
Newly plastered and painted . : 44926.22294796299
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify . : 13059.44721984437
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs , garlands of bronzefoil . : 18398.888279265087
Better value that for the money. Still , the flowers are more poetical . : 14226.666336466891
The other gets rather tiresome , never withering . : 19757.31871246946
Expresses nothing . : 316939.9456286843
Immortelles. : 56776224.999992244
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch . : 23755.468302142894
Like stuffed . : 147721.71540071006
Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us . : 20313.464768326736
Hoo ! : 654070.9864952827
Not a budge out of him. Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him . : 18907.035412827347
Dead animal even sadder . : 44926.22294796299
Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox , a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave. : 13606.813572992714
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it . : 24747.049153828164
Heart on his sleeve . : 44895.27623704038
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart . : 19572.600987647125
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that . : 20313.47139214359
Seems anything but pleased . : 80621.22855875334
Why this infliction ? : 118094.9482538271
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy . : 14411.043388972255
Apollo that was. : 147721.71540071006
How many ! : 203146.3353749423
All these here once walked round Dublin . : 30622.694557784944
Faithful departed. As you are now so once were we. : 37196.28849088396
Besides how could you remember everybody ? : 73795.1677086923
Eyes , walk , voice . : 59997.371126444166
Well , the voice , yes: gramophone . : 43482.670472359634
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house . : 32954.19923752151
After dinner on a Sunday . : 74790.24917660072
Put on poor old greatgrandfather. Kraahraark ! : 26974.43105546525
Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth . : 22999.514245861126
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face . : 18252.403331350164
Otherwise you couldn’t remember the face after fifteen years , say . : 21262.406676501218
For instance who ? : 133030.74467174814
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely’s. : 31266.908032873213
Rtststr ! : 654070.9864952827
A rattle of pebbles . : 74914.70630231591
Wait . : 654070.9864952827

Let him give us a three months’ renewal. : 30623.70537017231
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage . : 31653.38838844526
He began to check it silently . : 49548.07178869663

—Wait . : 654070.9864952827
Where’s the archbishop’s letter ? : 80625.38268462641
It’s to be repeated in the _Telegraph._ Where’s what’s his name ? : 21168.322066020464

—The ghost walks , professor MacHugh murmured softly , biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane. : 14234.223533629682
Mr Dedalus , staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing face , asked of it sourly: : 12724.490143186067
—Agonising Christ , wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse ? : 24580.241975531088
Ned Lambert , seated on the table , read on: : 32184.421979910985
—_Or again , note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way , tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles , to the tumbling waters of Neptune’s blue domain , ’mid mossy banks , fanned by gentlest zephyrs , played on by the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_. What about that , Simon ? : 9528.617038457693
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper . : 28054.27490497476
How’s that for high ? : 44925.06562279552
—Changing his drink , Mr Dedalus said. : 26974.088582100405
Ned Lambert , laughing , struck the newspaper on his knees , repeating: : 14969.283975608236
—_The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_. O boys ! : 18371.109694897652
O boys ! : 147721.71540071006
—And Xenophon looked upon Marathon , Mr Dedalus said , looking again on the fireplace and to the window , and Marathon looked on the sea. : 18723.506218745406
—That will do , professor MacHugh cried from the window . : 23340.85747156798
I don’t want to hear any more of the stuff. : 34007.49503898119

High falutin stuff . : 70202.74128010684

With an accent on the whose. : 78638.40586142208

Ned Lambert nodded. : 147721.71540071006
—But listen to this , he said. : 26925.617922638306
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in. : 17886.6120795524
—Excuse me , J. J. O’Molloy said , entering. : 20301.450393070238

—Good day , Jack. : 70160.25280616146

J. J. O’Molloy asked , looking towards the inner door. : 18394.88669693584
—Very much so , professor MacHugh said . : 35713.68149046231

Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside , chuckling with delight . : 30481.50718361667

Get a grip of them by the stomach. : 22959.00853056145
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face , crested by a comb of feathery hair , thrust itself in . : 10812.443524374388
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: : 15507.054669539159
—What is it ? : 87863.50138638135
—And here comes the sham squire himself ! : 22999.143943681538

Come on , Ned. : 169266.99745237708
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table . : 86063.75521437362
The editor’s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom’s face , shadowed by a smile. : 13998.869798771055
—Will you join us , Myles ? : 26966.519985096358

—Incipient jigs . : 147721.71540071006
Sad case. : 654070.9864952827
—Ohio ! : 654070.9864952827
the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face. My Ohio ! : 17111.003864870767
—A perfect cretic ! : 70202.74128010684
the professor said . : 320917.35128796566
Long , short and long. : 44925.06562279552
O , HARP EOLIAN ! : 44926.22294796299
He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and , breaking off a piece , twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth. : 11684.461050269525
—Bingbang , bangbang. : 147721.71540071006
Mr Bloom , seeing the coast clear , made for the inner door. : 15564.438669914829
—Just a moment , Mr Crawford , he said . : 40462.59396164506
I just want to phone about an ad. : 22240.72380475083
He went in. : 188812.65427145068
—What about that leader this evening ? : 44616.76736810851
professor MacHugh asked , coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder. : 13142.388975431617
—That’ll be all right , Myles Crawford said more calmly . : 16963.07889632208
Never you fret. Hello , Jack . : 44616.76736810851
That’s all right. : 147721.71540071006
—Good day , Myles , J. J. O’Molloy said , letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file . : 11299.008470397694
Is that Canada swindle case on today ? : 29191.38173024772
The telephone whirred inside. : 65933.15784360672
—Twentyeight... No , twenty... Double four... Yes. : 26968.084694449848
SPOT THE WINNER : 147721.71540071006
Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_’s tissues. : 29293.496562647408
—Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup ? : 18374.125836626277
he asked . : 391415.51316403976
Sceptre with O. Madden up. : 44926.22294796299
He tossed the tissues on to the table. : 25142.072531894184
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open. : 24835.221469506232
—Hush , Lenehan said . : 90876.76306101568
I hear feetstoops. : 135126.4897551565
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps . : 17591.991401504012
The tissues rustled up in the draught , floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth. : 13088.758429531601
—It wasn’t me , sir . : 33334.24100908377
It was the big fellow shoved me , sir. : 32036.496387239895
—Throw him out and shut the door , the editor said . : 40885.35699397368
There’s a hurricane blowing. : 70202.74128010684
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor , grunting as he stooped twice. : 13151.292890932487
—Waiting for the racing special , sir , the newsboy said . : 28448.122145398083
It was Pat Farrell shoved me , sir. : 28847.824693193143
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe. : 19802.896407566368
—Him , sir. : 147721.71540071006
—Out of this with you , professor MacHugh said gruffly. : 20979.39197920679
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to. : 19802.741280102724
J. J. O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over , murmuring , seeking: : 15853.243638770546
—Continued on page six , column four. : 26974.43105546525
—Yes , _Evening Telegraph_ here , Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office. Is the boss... ? : 15662.004664707281
Yes , _Telegraph_... To where ? : 33348.12901464862
Aha ! : 654070.9864952827
Which auction rooms ? : 70202.74128010684
... Aha ! : 147721.71540071006
I see... Right . : 65668.05553403238
I’ll catch him. : 147721.71540071006
A COLLISION ENSUES : 346397.6555345759
The bell whirred again as he rang off . : 27329.244037675347
He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue. : 17160.02485596175
—_Pardon , monsieur_ , Lenehan said , clutching him for an instant and making a grimace. : 19691.052832425008
—My fault , Mr Bloom said , suffering his grip . : 16961.126992351805
Are you hurt ? : 276260.8107162357
I’m in a hurry. : 70032.55997773593
—Knee , Lenehan said. : 70202.74128010684
He made a comic face and whined , rubbing his knee: : 24982.64106083534
—The accumulation of the _anno Domini_. : 33192.434902307374
—Sorry , Mr Bloom said. : 44926.58173378085
He went to the door and , holding it ajar , paused . : 28288.25934516805
J. J. O’Molloy slapped the heavy pages over . : 20315.46466490149
The noise of two shrill voices , a mouthorgan , echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: : 11153.442227192236
We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand. : 19618.433767392064
EXIT BLOOM : 654070.9864952827
—I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk , Mr Bloom said , about this ad of Keyes’s . : 12370.065662734376
Want to fix it up . : 60002.43415998043
They tell me he’s round there in Dillon’s. : 24187.153747306544
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces . : 33141.977216986954
The editor who , leaning against the mantelshelf , had propped his head on his hand , suddenly stretched forth an arm amply. : 14916.808099207377
—Begone ! : 654070.9864952827
he said . : 1266210.5661733155
The world is before you. : 86423.19513971015
—Back in no time , Mr Bloom said , hurrying out. : 22117.228544902046
J. J. O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them , blowing them apart gently , without comment. : 11768.763840664255
—He’ll get that advertisement , the professor said , staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind . : 12359.558203417571
Look at the young scamps after him. : 26943.694921473107
—Show . : 654070.9864952827
Where ? : 3806582.195480173
Lenehan cried , running to the window. : 26889.64641196353
A STREET CORTÈGE : 346397.6555345759
Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom’s wake , the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite , a tail of white bowknots. : 9946.851889364745
—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry , Lenehan said , and you’ll kick . : 14202.232382774491
O , my rib risible ! : 33346.59862357748
Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk . : 20280.807212839532
Small nines . : 147721.71540071006
Steal upon larks. : 147721.71540071006
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J. J. O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands. : 12062.838406197736
—What’s that ? : 147721.71540071006
Myles Crawford said with a start . : 44571.90748722107
Where are the other two gone ? : 73758.00413384754
—Who ? : 654070.9864952827
the professor said , turning . : 51067.11705070119
They’re gone round to the Oval for a drink . : 26103.342189760686
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall . : 22996.92173100508
Came over last night. : 70202.74128010684
—Come on then , Myles Crawford said . : 35711.981690003064
Where’s my hat ? : 70202.74128010684
He walked jerkily into the office behind , parting the vent of his jacket , jingling his keys in his back pocket . : 11454.682047080816
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer. : 16795.95747684167
—He’s pretty well on , professor MacHugh said in a low voice. : 24457.985814388314
—Seems to be , J. J. O’Molloy said , taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation , but it is not always as it seems . : 16052.852876374649
Who has the most matches ? : 48831.95801180057
THE CALUMET OF PEACE : 70202.74128010684
He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself . : 20011.865385041106
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn . : 14254.707740255628
J. J. O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it. : 18397.495363327165
—_Thanky vous_ , Lenehan said , helping himself. : 22993.16860710537
The editor came from the inner office , a straw hat awry on his brow . : 12943.871638233344
He declaimed in song , pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: : 19803.904640093664
’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee , ’Twas empire charmed thy heart. : 14973.251772583939
The professor grinned , locking his long lips. : 22288.79419986676
—Eh ? : 654070.9864952827
You bloody old Roman empire ? : 41007.575941374074
Myles Crawford said. : 147721.71540071006
He took a cigarette from the open case . : 45077.94865767357
Lenehan , lighting it for him with quick grace , said: : 16958.8186744487
—Silence for my brandnew riddle ! : 33351.43187735762
—_Imperium romanum_ , J. J. O’Molloy said gently . : 20317.500783260028
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton . : 23892.422897575714
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire. : 17901.540760758857
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling. : 18394.643640226674
—That’s it , he said . : 137799.4245668618
We are the fat . : 74901.2433252563
You and I are the fat in the fire. We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell. : 18602.050648650133
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME : 44926.22294796299
—Wait a moment , professor MacHugh said , raising two quiet claws . : 17850.761580410934
We mustn’t be led away by words , by sounds of words . : 18215.153783086505
We think of Rome , imperial , imperious , imperative. : 23754.93043674624
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs , pausing: : 19804.669937441962
—What was their civilisation ? : 44923.908178359256
Vast , I allow: but vile . : 26944.577584840503
Cloacae: sewers. The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to be here . : 16312.980781686512
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_. The Roman , like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps , brought to every new shore on which he set his foot ( on our shore he never set it ) only his cloacal obsession . : 10529.586257358345
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be here . : 18972.32300682103
Let us construct a watercloset._ : 71022.82546830853
—Which they accordingly did do , Lenehan said . : 30043.606334998985
Our old ancient ancestors , as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s , were partial to the running stream. : 15621.26578968606
—They were nature’s gentlemen , J. J. O’Molloy murmured . : 18398.651294802596
But we have also Roman law. : 59539.49674662758
—And Pontius Pilate is its prophet , professor MacHugh responded. : 18398.888279265087
—Do you know that story about chief baron Palles ? : 24639.38196362332
J. J. O’Molloy asked. It was at the royal university dinner . : 21239.015948723743
Everything was going swimmingly ... : 44920.52064779619
—First my riddle , Lenehan said . : 44615.946292605026
Are you ready ? : 276260.8107162357
Mr O’Madden Burke , tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed , came in from the hallway . : 12727.000704516047
Stephen Dedalus , behind him , uncovered as he entered. : 24625.27299274823
—_Entrez , mes enfants ! : 44926.22294796299
_ Lenehan cried. : 147721.71540071006
—I escort a suppliant , Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously . : 16964.72981713253
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety. : 33362.18422894433

—Silence ! : 654070.9864952827
What opera resembles a railwayline ? : 39544.08348460558
Reflect , ponder , excogitate , reply. : 26974.43105546525
Stephen handed over the typed sheets , pointing to the title and signature. : 19598.150269343132
—Who ? : 654070.9864952827
the editor asked. : 346397.6555345759

—We were always loyal to lost causes , the professor said . : 21234.251266332478
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination . : 20984.87316470707

It was in that case of fratricide , the Childs murder case . : 28227.730433050405
Bushe defended him. : 147721.71540071006
_And in the porches of mine ear did pour._ : 20265.52969489927
By the way how did he find that out ? : 62675.45299444234
He died in his sleep . : 37672.73495683953
Or the other story , beast with two backs ? : 18392.165038061245
—What was that ? : 70189.17457635292
the professor asked. : 346397.6555345759
ITALIA , MAGISTRA ARTIUM : 70202.74128010684
—He spoke on the law of evidence , J. J. O’Molloy said , of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code , the _lex talionis_. And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican. : 12738.440226859539
—Ha. : 56776224.999992244
—A few wellchosen words , Lenehan prefaced . : 22996.578384278913
Silence ! : 654070.9864952827
Pause . : 654070.9864952827
J. J. O’Molloy took out his cigarettecase. : 26973.934713100607
False lull . : 147721.71540071006
Something quite ordinary. : 147721.71540071006
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar. : 18398.651294802596
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act , trivial in itself , that striking of that match , that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives. : 11768.165987887585
A POLISHED PERIOD : 346397.6555345759
J. J. O’Molloy resumed , moulding his words: : 22999.514245861126
—He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music , horned and terrible , of the human form divine , that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which , if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live , deserves to live._ : 9711.741593164777
His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall. : 20358.32747101831
—Fine ! : 654070.9864952827
Myles Crawford said at once. : 44926.22294796299
—The divine afflatus , Mr O’Madden Burke said. : 22999.629043614965
—You like it ? : 87869.16271059001
J. J. O’Molloy asked Stephen. : 44926.22294796299
Stephen , his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture , blushed . : 14252.197550021025
He took a cigarette from the case . : 77598.70255123654
J. J. O’Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford . : 18398.651294802596
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy , saying: : 15853.908500560121
—Muchibus thankibus. : 654070.9864952827
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE : 74916.63619766088
—Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you , J. J. O’Molloy said to Stephen . : 16396.21778021028
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd , the opal hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic ? : 18015.19990893375
That Blavatsky woman started it. She was a nice old bag of tricks . : 27333.653164095504
A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness . : 19300.4373259596
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A. E.’s leg . : 22913.77483685509
He is a man of the very highest morale , Magennis. : 46478.963293998015
Speaking about me . : 145748.55695466686
What did he say ? : 80666.64366925051
What did he say ? : 80666.64366925051
What did he say about me ? : 64104.289047067374
Don’t ask. : 654070.9864952827
—No , thanks , professor MacHugh said , waving the cigarettecase aside. Wait a moment . : 18679.981693300477
Let me say one thing . : 109575.64897588502
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society . : 15385.575290503908
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon , the present lord justice of appeal , had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay ( new for those days ) , advocating the revival of the Irish tongue. : 9849.075627984592
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: : 29964.039431382294
—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon . : 44926.22294796299
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse. : 61370.49705332723
—He is sitting with Tim Healy , J. J. O’Molloy said , rumour has it , on the Trinity college estates commission. : 12101.54625632546
—He is sitting with a sweet thing , Myles Crawford said , in a child’s frock . : 15340.568552065522
Go on . : 295487.6743844672
Well ? : 2348973.520800131
—It was the speech , mark you , the professor said , of a finished orator , full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement . : 13696.590764965713
It was then a new movement . : 34959.35718821065
We were weak , therefore worthless. : 51081.33092579929
He closed his long thin lips an instant but , eager to be on , raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and , with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims , steadied them to a new focus. : 11968.968555079819
IMPROMPTU : 56776224.999992244
In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O’Molloy: : 24656.651982530704
—Taylor had come there , you must know , from a sickbed . : 40334.44785990109
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall . : 36187.523458924465
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it . : 17267.710041563943
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked ( though he was not ) a dying man. : 15791.556271288477
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O’Molloy’s towards Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground , seeking . : 16693.905220652814
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head , soiled by his withering hair . : 14026.290618374844
Still seeking , he said: : 44845.70050741741
—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply. Briefly , as well as I can bring them to mind , his words were these. : 13206.309991019167
He raised his head firmly . : 37714.6910077774
His eyes bethought themselves once more. Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro , seeking outlet. : 12702.824432501995
He began: : 945159.3128138575
_—Mr Chairman , ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend . : 13479.008026778834
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country , into an age remote from this age , that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses._ : 12251.433131974012
His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear , their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech . : 13902.6077574467
_And let our crooked smokes._ Noble words coming . : 20317.210009136208
Look out . : 477851.1884845812
Could you try your hand at it yourself ? : 61501.054574739646
_—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride . : 18747.129813776777
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me._ : 16554.01228226267
FROM THE FATHERS : 147721.71540071006
It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted . : 13190.721902763094
Ah , curse you ! : 59637.73062940808
That’s saint Augustine. : 147721.71540071006
_—Why will you jews not accept our culture , our religion and our language ? : 13662.36014256998
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys , trireme and quadrireme , laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe . : 11814.97849459704
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature , a priesthood , an agelong history and a polity._ : 14448.4936571536
Nile. : 56776224.999992244
Child , man , effigy. : 44906.84669289299
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel , cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned , stonebearded , heart of stone. : 14328.361563505761
_—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples , majestic and mysterious , are the abodes of Isis and Osiris , of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom , awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas . : 9412.955439691465
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms . : 12372.078071388734
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name._ : 15850.830122302921
A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech . : 26991.20595120308
He lifted his voice above it boldly: : 29964.59100724706
_—But , ladies and gentlemen , had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life , had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage , nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day . : 12667.182590315138
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law , graven in the language of the outlaw._ : 12229.947483812068
He ceased and looked at them , enjoying a silence. : 28150.916668097914
OMINOUS—FOR HIM ! : 147721.71540071006
J. J. O’Molloy said not without regret: : 26972.978651891168
—And yet he died without having entered the land of promise. : 16961.741216617764
—A—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously— expectorated—demise , Lenehan added . : 33362.90043662681
And with a great future behind him. : 47311.48227381831
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase. : 12957.106696232271
—That is oratory , the professor said uncontradicted. : 22953.88361518239
Gone with the wind . : 90659.52970020885
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings . : 20248.23442924593
Miles of ears of porches . : 33362.90043662681
The tribune’s words , howled and scattered to the four winds . : 15497.435549690405
A people sheltered within his voice . : 64284.98044080465
Dead noise . : 147721.71540071006
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was . : 26391.392350858216
Love and laud him: me no more. : 26973.438315931293
I have money. : 289158.60091846465
—Gentlemen , Stephen said . : 90876.76306101568
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn ? : 15906.602641873242
—You take my breath away . : 41005.81521212254
It is not perchance a French compliment ? : 35737.59106829369
Mr O’Madden Burke asked . : 49834.223974306835
’Tis the hour , methinks , when the winejug , metaphorically speaking , is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry. : 14872.88027493939
—That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved . : 20315.180914566386
All that are in favour say ay , Lenehan announced . : 28774.182395187232
The contrary no . : 65928.9644120238
I declare it carried . : 86145.0912654272
To which particular boosing shed... ? : 41589.798539409974
My casting vote is: Mooney’s ! : 43785.8832631022
He led the way , admonishing: : 89906.92667084133
—We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters , will we not ? : 23578.496518302698
Yes , we will not . : 175396.1827599177
By no manner of means. : 71011.88684000257
Mr O’Madden Burke , following close , said with an ally’s lunge of his umbrella: : 17861.502708233274
—Lay on , Macduff ! : 44906.61843287879
—Chip of the old block ! : 33191.00972928214
the editor cried , clapping Stephen on the shoulder . : 23737.511770328918
Let us go . : 220610.6348752908
Where are those blasted keys ? : 60011.420715940854
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets. : 19788.898274513933
—Foot and mouth . : 70202.74128010684
I know . : 1157469.870762322
That’ll be all right . : 90862.71532895305
That’ll go in . : 70198.27629765916
Where are they ? : 408554.8883682422
That’s all right. : 147721.71540071006
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office. : 24975.126268189542
LET US HOPE : 147721.71540071006
J. J. O’Molloy , about to follow him in , said quietly to Stephen: : 23570.343881066892
—I hope you will live to see it published . : 39753.90832108456
Myles , one moment. : 70186.9690995208
He went into the inner office , closing the door behind him. : 22600.483425076935
—Come along , Stephen , the professor said . : 29995.688605037805
That is fine , isn’t it ? : 41269.16676990469
It has the prophetic vision . : 63129.74279893351
_Fuit Ilium ! : 147721.71540071006
_ The sack of windy Troy. Kingdoms of this world . : 29468.178351270522
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today. : 22203.684680866427
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street , yelling: : 15867.353546539556
—Racing special ! : 147721.71540071006
Dublin . : 654070.9864952827
I have much , much to learn. : 59468.41473651977
They turned to the left along Abbey street. : 24124.059397343368
—I have a vision too , Stephen said. : 22989.97196981287
—Yes ? : 654070.9864952827
the professor said , skipping to get into step . : 33776.672807194
Crawford will follow. : 147721.71540071006
Another newsboy shot past them , yelling as he ran: : 26147.376507931407
—Racing special ! : 147721.71540071006
DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN : 147721.71540071006
Dubliners. : 56776224.999992244
—Two Dublin vestals , Stephen said , elderly and pious , have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane. : 11772.236518999442
—Where is that ? : 70193.69768501108
the professor asked. : 346397.6555345759
—Off Blackpitts , Stephen said. : 44926.22294796299
Damp night reeking of hungry dough . : 26974.43105546525
Against the wall . : 70202.74128010684
Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl . : 22999.143943681538
Frantic hearts . : 147721.71540071006
Akasic records. Quicker , darlint ! : 33362.90043662681
On now . : 902457.7126819269
Dare it . : 195249.81019365854
Let there be life. : 124444.66100890307
—They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar. They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox . : 16631.494284338107
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife . : 12001.0902551365
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers . : 15854.755266723292
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain. : 12012.126980529825
—Wise virgins , professor MacHugh said. : 33362.90043662681
LIFE ON THE RAW : 70202.74128010684
—They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins , proprietress... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn . : 9608.196490192719
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase , grunting , encouraging each other , afraid of the dark , panting , one asking the other have you the brawn , praising God and the Blessed Virgin , threatening to come down , peeping at the airslits . : 9501.874463541619
Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that high. : 20203.00020188154
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe . : 24704.95911755497
Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water , given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father . : 11944.45124959663
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday. : 13659.891466144905
—Antithesis , the professor said nodding twice . : 22953.88361518239
Vestal virgins . : 147721.71540071006
I can see them . : 102934.72960403397
What’s keeping our friend ? : 44925.06562279552
He turned. : 945159.3128138575
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps , scattering in all directions , yelling , their white papers fluttering . : 12697.066913373292
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps , his hat aureoling his scarlet face , talking with J. J. O’Molloy. : 13260.262255900487
—Come along , the professor cried , waving his arm. : 18368.756752650075
He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side. : 48217.49795308653
RETURN OF BLOOM : 147721.71540071006
—Yes , he said . : 137516.41542181053
I see them. : 135097.46974756257
Mr Bloom , breathless , caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_ , called: : 10976.417516279073
—Mr Crawford ! : 147721.71540071006
A moment ! : 346397.6555345759
—_Telegraph_ ! : 654070.9864952827
Racing special ! : 147721.71540071006
—What is it ? : 87863.50138638135
Myles Crawford said , falling back a pace. : 22993.16860710537
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face: : 38865.468816560104
—Terrible tragedy in Rathmines ! : 44926.22294796299
A child bit by a bellows ! : 38849.04958111237
INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR : 70202.74128010684
—Just this ad , Mr Bloom said , pushing through towards the steps , puffing , and taking the cutting from his pocket . : 14615.657309100128
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now . : 53655.511469671874
He’ll give a renewal for two months , he says . : 16947.66960443993
After he’ll see . : 97703.61332255058
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too , the Saturday pink . : 15591.77277630844
And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_. I can have access to it in the national library . : 14763.237035606755
House of keys , don’t you see ? : 22997.310285763208
His name is Keyes . : 111426.34537536143
It’s a play on the name . : 73697.85181519492
But he practically promised he’d give the renewal . : 29895.634506103896
But he wants just a little puff . : 22851.58149670058
What will I tell him , Mr Crawford ? : 46543.51069056245
K.M.A. : 56776224.999992244
—Will you tell him he can kiss my arse ? : 18396.772761404845

He does canvassing for the _Freeman._ : 37633.382947754915
—I know him well to see , Davy Byrne said . : 32175.626568552798
Is he in trouble ? : 133086.13356244203
—Trouble ? : 654070.9864952827
Nosey Flynn said . : 169353.91770043052
Not that I heard of . : 241859.84166805854
Why ? : 1850884.7781121505
—I noticed he was in mourning. : 54196.58482770745
—Was he ? : 346442.2817392224
Nosey Flynn said . : 169353.91770043052
So he was , faith . : 97508.56813065616
I asked him how was all at home . : 30919.59930931435
You’re right , by God . : 33320.431622707256
So he was. : 477952.30475725327
—I never broach the subject , Davy Byrne said humanely , if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way . : 16229.404589484222
It only brings it up fresh in their minds. : 21010.544801686956
—It’s not the wife anyhow , Nosey Flynn said . : 26161.52368345217
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan’s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half . : 12646.195438842287
She’s well nourished , I tell you . : 59110.060307718435
Plovers on toast. : 147721.71540071006
—And is he doing for the _Freeman ? : 22960.08851990202
_ Davy Byrne said. : 70202.74128010684
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips. : 44926.22294796299
—He doesn’t buy cream on the ads he picks up . : 23348.000442294284
You can make bacon of that. : 41003.17386300333
—How so ? : 295588.9145688489
Davy Byrne asked , coming from his book. : 22993.955994723077
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers . : 15824.838405445736
He winked. : 945159.3128138575
—He’s in the craft , he said. : 26851.321441738924
—Do you tell me so ? : 124308.84245413997
Davy Byrne said. : 147721.71540071006
—Very much so , Nosey Flynn said . : 35713.68149046231
Ancient free and accepted order . : 33362.18422894433
He’s an excellent brother . : 44916.96279564015
Light , life and love , by God . : 20297.085689662283
They give him a leg up . : 68087.5849322045
I was told that by a—well , I won’t say who. : 38638.29446910137
—Is that a fact ? : 44910.0384315641
—O , it’s a fine order , Nosey Flynn said . : 23366.547281995772
They stick to you when you’re down . : 24180.989616028062
I know a fellow was trying to get into it . : 79414.6799359376
But they’re as close as damn it . : 25391.07230326458
By God they did right to keep the women out of it. : 25726.309365086716
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: : 33358.60203689765
—Iiiiiichaaaaaaach ! : 654070.9864952827
—There was one woman , Nosey Flynn said , hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing . : 11982.809680030781
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason . : 14465.601885917382
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile. : 38531.56670865254
Davy Byrne , sated after his yawn , said with tearwashed eyes: : 21261.73814945875
—And is that a fact ? : 33350.01997944299
Decent quiet man he is . : 107857.8086841859
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him—you know , over the line. : 18962.719529522852
—God Almighty couldn’t make him drunk , Nosey Flynn said firmly . : 15852.719384439046
Slips off when the fun gets too hot . : 20310.529224928447
Didn’t you see him look at his watch ? : 30035.467344347355
Ah , you weren’t there . : 48836.98043388245
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe . : 18578.369204207553
Declare to God he does. : 44926.22294796299
—There are some like that , Davy Byrne said . : 26159.439979989354
He’s a safe man , I’d say. : 26966.61687266589
—He’s not too bad , Nosey Flynn said , snuffling it up . : 19629.05412848089
He’s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow . : 14253.9209060239
Give the devil his due . : 33360.751767446214
O , Bloom has his good points . : 22998.403214093603
But there’s one thing he’ll never do. : 26799.366552396183
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog. : 20372.930619498933
—I know , Davy Byrne said. : 33350.82110260668
—Nothing in black and white , Nosey Flynn said. : 20317.210009136208
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in . : 22996.949291211953
Tom Rochford followed frowning , a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat. : 15843.57241524342
—Day , Mr Byrne. : 70203.44208944037
—Day , gentlemen. : 147721.71540071006
They paused at the counter. : 48641.99296838392
—Who’s standing ? : 147721.71540071006
Paddy Leonard asked. : 147721.71540071006
—I’m sitting anyhow , Nosey Flynn answered. : 26974.43105546525
—Well , what’ll it be ? : 97681.44587717771
Paddy Leonard asked. : 147721.71540071006
—I’ll take a stone ginger , Bantam Lyons said. : 20316.053834137867
—How much ? : 477972.8260027753
Paddy Leonard cried . : 70198.38690741721
Since when , for God’ sake ? : 44573.09196819201
What’s yours , Tom ? : 44923.93704209566
—How is the main drainage ? : 33340.73660478191
Nosey Flynn asked , sipping. : 44925.06562279552
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped. : 19608.219322641547
—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water , Mr Byrne ? : 14252.189326359996
he said. : 2821620.7786225514
—Certainly , sir. : 147721.71540071006
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates. : 44926.22294796299
—Lord love a duck , he said . : 46276.85379783305
Look at what I’m standing drinks to ! : 22998.773599762393
Cold water and gingerpop ! : 44926.22294796299
Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg. He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup . : 11100.920215419035
A dead snip. : 346397.6555345759
—Zinfandel is it ? : 87863.50138638135
Nosey Flynn asked. : 147721.71540071006
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him. : 14250.413005686612
—That cursed dyspepsia , he said before drinking. : 29795.46927812723
—Breadsoda is very good , Davy Byrne said. : 22985.498028757745
Tom Rochford nodded and drank. : 44926.22294796299
—Is it Zinfandel ? : 70202.74128010684
—Say nothing ! : 477972.8260027753
Bantam Lyons winked . : 70202.74128010684
I’m going to plunge five bob on my own. : 20310.604793237737
—Tell us if you’re worth your salt and be damned to you , Paddy Leonard said . : 17922.937535067114
Who gave it to you ? : 373015.6212881956
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting. : 24487.30293315445
—So long ! : 147721.71540071006
Nosey Flynn said. : 147721.71540071006
The others turned. : 439574.32628005923
—That’s the man now that gave it to me , Bantam Lyons whispered. : 28683.44582462132
—Prrwht ! : 654070.9864952827
Paddy Leonard said with scorn . : 33361.46803663681
Mr Byrne , sir , we’ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a... : 16938.8484729366
—Stone ginger , Davy Byrne added civilly. : 26974.43105546525
—Ay , Paddy Leonard said . : 60010.13227348695
A suckingbottle for the baby. : 74715.11635500059
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street , his tongue brushing his teeth smooth . : 14789.023715197924
Something green it would have to be: spinach , say . : 27770.31289114395

Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller , plumber , turned back his thoughts . : 21498.042964375174
They could: and watch it all the way down , swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after , tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes . : 10305.689497437854

Mr Bloom turned at Gray’s confectioner’s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan’s bookstore . : 12734.484909893941

A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane . : 19616.11800618035
No tram in sight . : 122232.11624676296
Wants to cross. : 147721.71540071006
—Do you want to cross ? : 59998.56388119962
Mr Bloom asked. : 175586.31393135735
The blind stripling did not answer . : 56851.66899309061
His wallface frowned weakly . : 55083.78261804185
He moved his head uncertainly. : 52048.37814562025
—You’re in Dawson street , Mr Bloom said . : 30048.389614587093
Molesworth street is opposite. Do you want to cross ? : 26162.472384724857
There’s nothing in the way. : 90454.39248763058
The cane moved out trembling to the left . : 19710.666671888594
Mr Bloom’s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before Drago’s . : 13133.005155076284
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was . : 54551.596474554484

—There’s a van there , Mr Bloom said , but it’s not moving . : 14241.869785205276
I’ll see you across . : 44923.965433553545
Do you want to go to Molesworth street ? : 98796.4114503301
—Yes , the stripling answered . : 54168.61428523559
South Frederick street. : 147721.71540071006
—Come , Mr Bloom said. : 44926.58173378085
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward. : 13783.232908560678
Say something to him . : 81742.44887334743
Better not do the condescending . : 33352.94141943848
They mistrust what you tell them . : 53707.65341236505

—The rain kept off. : 70202.74128010684
No answer. : 1851129.1053673674
Stains on his coat . : 90818.84338633195
Slobbers his food , I suppose . : 30890.237630652624
Tastes all different for him . : 54961.96003784425
Have to be spoonfed first . : 87442.91972641303
Like a child’s hand , his hand . : 49141.87309339441
Like Milly’s was . : 124428.713616814
Sensitive . : 654070.9864952827
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand . : 30043.522860252804

—Right now ? : 147721.71540071006
First turn to the left. : 90474.55955695361
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way , drawing his cane back , feeling again. : 14313.854523362957
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet , a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed . : 14138.538631955556
Poor young fellow ! : 320938.02108676225
How on earth did he know that van was there ? : 35100.194966017865
Must have felt it . : 107414.41292946094
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume . : 15846.968057097067
Weight or size of it , something blacker than the dark. Wonder would he feel it if something was removed . : 14110.536893067276
Feel a gap . : 70202.74128010684
Queer idea of Dublin he must have , tapping his way round by the stones . : 15174.006394037415
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane ? : 27101.03337860507
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest. : 17653.37688619239
Penrose ! : 654070.9864952827
That was that chap’s name. : 68096.23273730872
Look at all the things they can learn to do . : 36196.09611956093
Read with their fingers. Tune pianos . : 26969.46516403396
Or we are surprised they have any brains . : 20311.43457492515
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say . : 16885.49840324274
Of course the other senses are more . : 47541.50357632596
Embroider . : 654070.9864952827
Plait baskets. People ought to help . : 26968.148159565455
Workbasket I could buy for Molly’s birthday. Hates sewing . : 18394.462297091934
Might take an objection . : 44922.750912821575
Dark men they call them. : 44926.22294796299
Sense of smell must be stronger too . : 22978.18965340391
Smells on all sides , bunched together . : 35716.56116505922
Each street different smell . : 44926.22294796299
Each person too . : 70193.69768501108
Then the spring , the summer: smells . : 35651.98843864462
Tastes ? : 654070.9864952827
They say you can’t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head . : 18625.805626045396
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure. : 18356.28937651565

If thou didst ever... : 90587.0840116769
—What is a ghost ? : 44875.81686662756
Stephen said with tingling energy . : 33361.46803663681
One who has faded into impalpability through death , through absence , through change of manners . : 19277.048818424

It is the ghost , the king , a king and no king , and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre . : 13673.515234869885

A man of genius makes no mistakes . : 49162.44169466169
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery. : 20370.568502546965
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian , softcreakfooted , bald , eared and assiduous. : 12356.50763770968

His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull , to remind , to chide them not unkindly , then to the baldpink lollard costard , guiltless though maligned. : 11967.106279171008
—He had a good groatsworth of wit , Stephen said , and no truant memory. He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat , sitting in his form , the cry of hounds , the studded bridle and her blue windows . : 9874.7129850398

But his boywomen are the women of a boy. Their life , thought , speech are lent them by males . : 11494.16181993695
He chose badly ? : 84390.61216777567
He was chosen , it seems to me . : 96756.4618726566

We know nothing but that he lived and suffered . : 23736.367067231622

Others abide our question . : 44925.06562279552

Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: : 147721.71540071006
—I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you. : 13666.147650577235

—As we , or mother Dana , weave and unweave our bodies , Stephen said , from day to day , their molecules shuttled to and fro , so does the artist weave and unweave his image . : 9524.604522521277
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born , though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time , so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth . : 11526.706674154932
In the intense instant of imagination , when the mind , Shelley says , is a fading coal , that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be . : 15138.10191032147
So in the future , the sister of the past , I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be. : 19006.421632738664
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile. : 22996.949182578846

I feel Hamlet quite young . : 31904.825546727458

And we ought to mention another Irish commentator , Mr George Bernard Shaw . : 15330.919297570677
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris . : 33146.45622843036

Belief in himself has been untimely killed . : 22984.763604564752

But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come . : 12339.8773708041
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator . : 11636.070942875425
That is why the speech ( his lean unlovely English ) is always turned elsewhere , backward . : 13887.24383081795
Ravisher and ravished , what he would but would not , go with him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast , bare , with its mole cinquespotted . : 15895.65135492504

Brisk in a galliard he was off , out . : 26114.724411305557
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal , in duty bound , most fair , most kind , most honest broadbrim. : 12061.143714351183

Good day , sir . : 44902.2128210437
_Kilkenny_... We have certainly... : 70189.28737620523
A patient silhouette waited , listening. : 51089.199782858705
—All the leading provincial... _Northern Whig , Cork Examiner , Enniscorthy Guardian , _ 1903... Will you please ? : 12053.602318684118
... Evans , conduct this gentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or , please allow me... This way... Please , sir... : 11304.893277836747
Voluble , dutiful , he led the way to all the provincial papers , a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels. : 18618.083150370443
The door closed. : 135865.98758199185
—The sheeny ! : 147721.71540071006
Buck Mulligan cried. : 147721.71540071006
He jumped up and snatched the card. : 29964.63174387521
—What’s his name ? : 169343.00776393502

—He knows you . : 118055.21532437697
He knows your old fellow . : 37717.12051887348

—Antisthenes , pupil of Gorgias , Stephen said , took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam , Argive Helen , the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept , and handed it to poor Penelope . : 10113.776918674646
Twenty years he lived in London and , during part of that time , he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland . : 13302.759874033502
His life was rich . : 55080.94449239282
His art , more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it , is the art of surfeit . : 25628.98510546102
Hot herringpies , green mugs of sack , honeysauces , sugar of roses , marchpane , gooseberried pigeons , ringocandies . : 11526.733939442109

Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures . : 11773.37708326469
You know Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare , overhearing , without more ado about nothing , took the cow by the horns and , when Burbage came knocking at the gate , answered from the capon’s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_. And the gay lakin , mistress Fitton , mount and cry O , and his dainty birdsnies , lady Penelope Rich , a clean quality woman is suited for a player , and the punks of the bankside , a penny a time. : inf

But do. Afar , in a reek of lust and squalor , hands are laid on whiteness. : 13379.915664621185
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply. : 26974.43105546525
—Whom do you suspect ? : 44911.53819839169
he challenged. : 2821620.7786225514
—Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets . : 27331.872215999323
Once spurned twice spurned . : 44926.22294796299
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord , his dearmylove. : 19102.206591163937
Love that dare not speak its name. : 26970.48450250302
—As an Englishman , you mean , John sturdy Eglinton put in , he loved a lord. : 17917.111374825763
Old wall where sudden lizards flash . : 26974.43105546525
At Charenton I watched them. : 62264.65952589776
—It seems so , Stephen said , when he wants to do for him , and for all other and singular uneared wombs , the holy office an ostler does for the stallion . : 14042.064018036233
Maybe , like Socrates , he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife . : 24069.110229585367
But she , the giglot wanton , did not break a bedvow . : 22607.799890032213
Two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined , deceased husband’s brother . : 10614.4612865579
Sweet Ann , I take it , was hot in the blood . : 24490.989348572894
Once a wooer , twice a wooer. : 26973.934713100607
Stephen turned boldly in his chair. : 33322.923470088404
—The burden of proof is with you not with me , he said frowning . : 17480.55210575918
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him . : 16833.358837802258
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary , her goodman John , Ann , her poor dear Willun , when he went and died on her , raging that he was the first to go , Joan , her four brothers , Judith , her husband and all her sons , Susan , her husband too , while Susan’s daughter , Elizabeth , to use granddaddy’s words , wed her second , having killed her first. : 12373.248593683495

In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father’s shepherd . : 15169.334292039013
Explain you then . : 169332.10204345832
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity. : 16951.233533951694
He faced their silence. : 84390.61216777567
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will. But that has been explained , I believe , by jurists. She was entitled to her widow’s dower At common law . : 11703.316148289781
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us. Him Satan fleers , Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter , for his daughters , For his sister , for his old cronies in Stratford And in London . : 14007.717750362432
And therefore when he was urged , As I believe , to name her He left her his Secondbest Bed. : 18645.694920441616

—Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then , John Eglinton observed , as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type. : 11572.974440771864
—He was a rich country gentleman , Stephen said , with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard , a capitalist shareholder , a bill promoter , a tithefarmer . : 10648.790049859028
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace ? : 15922.827669015902
—It is clear that there were two beds , a best and a secondbest , Mr Secondbest Best said finely. : 16242.362397691655
—_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_ , bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on. : 14251.680403481962
—Antiquity mentions famous beds , Second Eglinton puckered , bedsmiling. Let me think. : 14971.325239035395
—Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage , Stephen said , who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves , pays tribute to his elders , wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress ( don’t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis ) and let her live in his villa. : 8599.133380689227
—Do you mean he died so ? : 36309.94580766743
Mr Best asked with slight concern . : 29046.313787766663
I mean... : 572301.727620578

—Lovely ! : 654070.9864952827
Buck Mulligan suspired amorously . : 44926.22294796299
I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard . : 24084.114346548857
He lifted his hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those days._ Lovely ! : 11937.087570485199

Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen’s leech Lopez , his jew’s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting . : 9056.1973855837

—Saint Thomas , Stephen smiling said , whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original , writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of , likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions . : 9598.437365608563
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who , it may be , hungers for it . : 15574.834983381754

In old age she takes up with gospellers ( one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask ) and heard she had a soul . : 10501.387536257858
She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the _Merry Wives_ and , loosing her nightly waters on the jordan , she thought over _Hooks and Eyes for Believers’ Breeches_ and _The most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze_. Venus has twisted her lips in prayer . : 10332.612305784749

He wrote the play in the months that followed his father’s death. If you hold that he , a greying man with two marriageable daughters , with thirtyfive years of life , _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_ , with fifty of experience , is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen . : 9643.729790269905

He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words . : 84386.96617798526
But one should be charitable . : 33079.28494007137
Invincible ignorance . : 147709.0303123794
They acted according to their lights. : 64164.578268068064
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road . : 19631.429531873368
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare . : 36359.08237982774
Surely , there ought to be. : 33349.36061849024
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street . : 33791.04621178115
All raised untidy caps . : 71026.34885351249
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys. : 20883.235428078133
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked . : 19608.05801266785
Saint Joseph’s church , Portland row . : 26973.46287124895
For aged and virtuous females . : 51088.103041361486
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament . : 18358.364639609903
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered. : 26943.984933124375
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman . : 16958.528809574305
And now it was an office or something. : 62936.694692061756
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop . : 12139.464079914851
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter . : 11773.909846563836
He passed Grogan’s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York . : 12523.862575978037
In America those things were continually happening . : 24657.05892299373
Unfortunate people to die like that , unprepared . : 20309.954325431638
Still , an act of perfect contrition. : 26968.969936931462
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged . : 12736.069253086855
They saluted him and were saluted. : 35679.46876640686
Father Conmee passed H. J. O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable . : 9523.643389383382
In Youkstetter’s , the porkbutcher’s , Father Conmee observed pig’s puddings , white and black and red , lie neatly curled in tubes. : 11372.781133032933
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge , a towhorse with pendent head , a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships , smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him . : 9649.391498033398
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people. : 9896.49156738172
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis Xavier’s church , upper Gardiner street , stepped on to an outward bound tram. : 11252.933011649151
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha’s church , north William street , on to Newcomen bridge. : 10766.105274246172
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island. : 11698.746336180804
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar , a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove , while four shillings , a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse . : 10812.828830148726
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket . : 11104.126575715904
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap . : 11353.335573055365
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum. : 44926.22294796299
It was a peaceful day . : 101148.0784160172
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down . : 13424.257149710056
His wife , Father Conmee supposed . : 31195.795270651986
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses . : 26540.451681212962
She raised her small gloved fist , yawned ever so gently , tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily , sweetly. : 10611.195647102008
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car . : 20265.23966456022
He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat. : 32741.942522007037
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head. : 12378.59906564892
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and , when it was about to go , an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight . : 15973.826003687469
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her . : 18647.52237208702
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that , as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare , she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you , my child , _ that they have been absolved , _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life , so many cares , poor creatures. : inf
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee. : 22002.959252270397
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night . : 10354.06963662716
That book by the Belgian jesuit , _Le Nombre des Élus , _ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea . : 12719.016033666236
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not ( D.V. ) been brought . : 12101.391198109655
But they were God’s souls , created by God . : 37019.69286822955
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost , a waste , if one might say. : 17717.44210233952
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted , was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn. : 13115.386660064092
The Malahide road was quiet . : 57554.12231940206
It pleased Father Conmee , road and name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide . : 13417.503737030249
Lord Talbot de Malahide , immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the call to arms and she was maid , wife and widow in one day. Those were old worldish days , loyal times in joyous townlands , old times in the barony. : 9712.209209033323
Father Conmee , walking , thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort , daughter of lord Molesworth , first countess of Belvedere. : 12059.187780848131
A listless lady , no more young , walked alone the shore of lough Ennel , Mary , first countess of Belvedere , listlessly walking in the evening , not startled when an otter plunged . : 12358.833156195326
Who could know the truth ? : 158084.5349276693
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully , _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris , _ with her husband’s brother ? : 13825.182264274737
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did . : 24659.37076667869
Only God knew and she and he , her husband’s brother. : 23333.200325954083
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence , needed however for man’s race on earth , and of the ways of God which were not our ways. : 13584.628357699385
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore . : 16964.0722761216
He was humane and honoured there . : 59861.19437672524
He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom , ceiled with full fruit clusters . : 11264.371046175851
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom , noble to noble , were impalmed by Don John Conmee. : 16902.0661891259
It was a charming day. : 84068.72499494777
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages , curtseying to him with ample underleaves . : 13600.100927326712
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind . : 16148.394394748071
_Moutonner , _ the French said . : 44615.946292605026
A just and homely word. : 74916.63619766088
Father Conmee , reading his office , watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey . : 13164.184723469556
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field . : 17245.33823702837
He walked there , reading in the evening , and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play , young cries in the quiet evening . : 16370.771843100756
He was their rector: his reign was mild. : 34697.54228743716
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page. : 12052.130891958474
Nones . : 654070.9864952827
He should have read that before lunch . : 25204.98760496694
But lady Maxwell had come. : 44519.67103539095
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast. _Deus in adiutorium._ : 13663.295899963334
He walked calmly and read mutely the nones , walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ._ : 11461.409227428327
A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand . : 14793.043062132778
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig. : 12521.790242378545
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary . : 14238.101119543744
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum._ : 14973.400128891002
* * * : 855674.6763982998
Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner . : 11518.937988412068
He pulled himself erect , went to it and , spinning it on its axle , viewed its shape and brass furnishings . : 13020.266668477163
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway . : 18902.665733002505
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase , looking idly out. : 12944.109706640262
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge. : 16958.179558037988
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed , his hat downtilted , chewing his blade of hay. : 12370.038138895658
Constable 57C , on his beat , stood to pass the time of day. : 19598.742093774512
—That’s a fine day , Mr Kelleher. : 26963.269722348567
—Ay , Corny Kelleher said. : 44926.22294796299
—It’s very close , the constable said. : 26912.782458691003
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin. : 10485.96591232963
—What’s the best news ? : 74889.7811394016
he asked. : 2821620.7786225514
—I seen that particular party last evening , the constable said with bated breath. : 14238.926647502614
* * * : 855674.6763982998
A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner , skirting Rabaiotti’s icecream car , and jerked himself up Eccles street . : 15348.917950731635
Towards Larry O’Rourke , in shirtsleeves in his doorway , he growled unamiably: : 14944.236980456382
—_For England_... : 654070.9864952827
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus , halted and growled: : 15026.498556170875
—_home and beauty._ : 147721.71540071006
J. J. O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor. : 17057.500825981915
A stout lady stopped , took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her . : 18258.948913514203
The sailor grumbled thanks , glanced sourly at the unheeding windows , sank his head and swung himself forward four strides. : 11385.577425764235
He halted and growled angrily: : 52053.742711485604
—_For England_... : 654070.9864952827
Two barefoot urchins , sucking long liquorice laces , halted near him , gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths. : 13626.558377288567
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks , halted , lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: : 12529.604673922875
—_home and beauty._ : 147721.71540071006
The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two , ceased. The blind of the window was drawn aside . : 12261.404475942807
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell . : 21384.41992538544
A plump bare generous arm shone , was seen , held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps . : 13370.791891627512
A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path. : 15435.527465979796
One of the urchins ran to it , picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel’s cap , saying: : 15546.840769161381
—There , sir. : 147721.71540071006
* * * : 855674.6763982998
Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen. : 23639.10595357611
—Did you put in the books ? : 44469.267516139036
Boody asked. : 654070.9864952827
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow. : 11767.970313072005
—They wouldn’t give anything on them , she said. : 26156.05992799115
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields , his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble. : 14968.35351995173
—Where did you try ? : 44920.46400182496
Boody asked. : 654070.9864952827
—M’Guinness’s. : 56776224.999992244
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table. : 16950.413770756673
—Bad cess to her big face ! : 26934.95781760167
she cried. : 3806582.195480173
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes. : 23705.31524653845
—What’s in the pot ? : 44719.580624956354
she asked. : 3806582.195480173
—Shirts , Maggy said. : 70202.74128010684
Boody cried angrily: : 147721.71540071006
—Crickey , is there nothing for us to eat ? : 23747.305314720594
Katey , lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt , asked: : 14229.960981123058
—And what’s in this ? : 68082.42874198468
A heavy fume gushed in answer. : 51089.199782858705
—Peasoup , Maggy said. : 70202.74128010684
—Where did you get it ? : 38744.920717312765
Katey asked. : 654070.9864952827
—Sister Mary Patrick , Maggy said. : 33362.90043662681
The lacquey rang his bell. : 42726.73947819277
—Barang ! : 654070.9864952827
Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: : 30017.418235953963
—Give us it here. : 70202.74128010684
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl . : 15840.261040376772
Katey , sitting opposite Boody , said quietly , as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: : 14244.490068943594
—A good job we have that much . : 22989.575296541716
Where’s Dilly ? : 147721.71540071006
—Gone to meet father , Maggy said. : 26957.723674098335
Boody , breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup , added: : 14968.554018505183
—Our father who art not in heaven. : 26967.077774043293
Maggy , pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl , exclaimed: : 18398.888279265087
—Boody ! : 654070.9864952827
For shame ! : 346397.6555345759
A skiff , a crumpled throwaway , Elijah is coming , rode lightly down the Liffey , under Loopline bridge , shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers , sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains , between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay. : 10304.337122519972

The blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre . : 14686.944444528523
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar. : 13658.365827806265
—Put these in first , will you ? : 28196.076014640596
he said. : 2821620.7786225514
—Yes , sir , the blond girl said . : 44363.61600137217
And the fruit on top. : 55083.78261804185
—That’ll do , game ball , Blazes Boylan said. : 20311.456015750136
She bestowed fat pears neatly , head by tail , and among them ripe shamefaced peaches. : 16317.086546862067
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop , lifting fruits , young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes , sniffing smells. : 10363.03081969329
H. E. L. Y.’S filed before him , tallwhitehatted , past Tangier lane , plodding towards their goal. : 15042.593637131846
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries , drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain’s length. : 11467.713352556646
—Can you send them by tram ? : 26970.96878409573
Now ? : 3806582.195480173
A darkbacked figure under Merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s cart. : 19605.62722483458
—Certainly , sir . : 70198.33175338316
Is it in the city ? : 125764.51375709607
—O , yes , Blazes Boylan said . : 55478.63062289108
Ten minutes. : 2821807.0585916843
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil. : 19755.358377091292
—Will you write the address , sir ? : 42153.70322074657
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her. : 15846.023127949693
—Send it at once , will you ? : 43792.82378514746
he said . : 1266210.5661733155
It’s for an invalid. : 70196.01529513148
—Yes , sir . : 70198.33175338316
I will , sir. : 124303.72368871517
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket. : 20301.26729568839

Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse . : 18360.764581494164
A young pullet . : 320927.94439957716
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass. : 32574.7379757709
—This for me ? : 247505.99310284402
he asked gallantly. : 391415.51316403976
The blond girl glanced sideways at him , got up regardless , with his tie a bit crooked , blushing. : 15747.037356400073
—Yes , sir , she said. : 59877.74313901847
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches. : 18398.888279265087
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour , the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth. : 14003.289142685293
—May I say a word to your telephone , missy ? : 32176.529157856126

È peccato . : 147721.71540071006
Perchè la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita , via. Invece , Lei si sacrifica._ : 13164.396675979942
—_Sacrifizio incruento , _ Stephen said smiling , swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint , lightly. : 12053.925206145372
_—Speriamo , _ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly . : 18398.888279265087
_Ma , dia retta a me . : 40950.7721189089
Ci rifletta_. : 654070.9864952827
By the stern stone hand of Grattan , bidding halt , an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band. : 14767.95237636375
—_Ci rifletterò , _ Stephen said , glancing down the solid trouserleg. : 15850.830098327553
—_Ma , sul serio , eh ? : 26974.43105546525
_ Almidano Artifoni said. : 70202.74128010684
His heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly . : 31202.08482189009
Human eyes . : 477870.2021479615
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram. : 16397.715572818546
_—Eccolo , _ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste . : 18397.726754706822
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi . : 26974.43105546525
Addio , caro._ : 147721.71540071006
—_Arrivederla , maestro , _ Stephen said , raising his hat when his hand was freed . : 12737.30600860932
_E grazie._ : 654070.9864952827
—_Di che ? : 147721.71540071006

Almidano Artifoni , holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal , trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram . : 12943.573051803425
In vain he trotted , signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates. : 13997.134550967345

Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter. : 11940.845633168808
Too much mystery business in it . : 39084.97461898366
Is he in love with that one , Marion ? : 24490.26123643603
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye. : 30049.11677705206
The disk shot down the groove , wobbled a while , ceased and ogled them: six. : 16149.552555814318
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: : 42178.84417744248
—16 June 1904. : 147721.71540071006
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny’s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone’s statue was not , eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y.’S and plodded back as they had come. : 11975.929052298232
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall , charming soubrette , and , listlessly lolling , scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses . : 12126.132157549555
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks . : 33362.90043662681
She’s not nicelooking , is she ? : 62168.67328839265
The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight . : 11616.986961971072
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s . : 27234.057645398207
They kick out grand . : 48710.11364290876
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven. : 12538.605986529657
The telephone rang rudely by her ear. : 26010.647616359303
—Hello . : 654070.9864952827
Yes , sir . : 70151.716453902
No , sir . : 209295.21469368855
Yes , sir . : 70151.716453902
I’ll ring them up after five . : 26973.934713100607
Only those two , sir , for Belfast and Liverpool . : 32165.766027382193
All right , sir . : 71015.46034322226
Then I can go after six if you’re not back . : 23357.004253426025
A quarter after . : 133026.46100057045

Twentyseven and six . : 70202.74128010684
I’ll tell him . : 95606.93225606182
Yes: one , seven , six. : 33354.33633658379
She scribbled three figures on an envelope. : 26889.393142657227
—Mr Boylan ! : 147721.71540071006
Hello ! : 654070.9864952827

Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch. : 16881.523950560826
—Who’s that ? : 147721.71540071006
Ned Lambert asked . : 70202.74128010684
Is that Crotty ? : 113090.48006915707
—Ringabella and Crosshaven , a voice replied groping for foothold. : 18387.99320074845
—Hello , Jack , is that yourself ? : 35708.048479412304
Ned Lambert said , raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches . : 13660.69855537339
Come on . : 956047.7592364731
Mind your steps there. : 70202.74128010684
The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall . : 11872.199219656863
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them. : 16976.043226641203
—How interesting ! : 147721.71540071006
a refined accent said in the gloom. : 38738.46082508994
—Yes , sir , Ned Lambert said heartily . : 30048.288302950634
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O’Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road . : 10674.63973447069
You were never here before , Jack , were you ? : 22006.298046982178
—No , Ned. : 147721.71540071006
—He rode down through Dame walk , the refined accent said , if my memory serves me . : 14536.252028006436
The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court. : 19683.82798600748
—That’s right , Ned Lambert said . : 44612.66193008161
That’s quite right , sir. : 44920.46458346172
—If you will be so kind then , the clergyman said , the next time to allow me perhaps... : 14902.21388222252
—Certainly , Ned Lambert said . : 60010.13227348695
Bring the camera whenever you like . : 26971.973809402098
I’ll get those bags cleared away from the windows . : 37176.926811433
You can take it from here or from here. : 23308.32264654574
In the still faint light he moved about , tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor. : 12564.934749119837
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard. : 18853.886053740876
—I’m deeply obliged , Mr Lambert , the clergyman said . : 23333.727223888833
I won’t trespass on your valuable time... : 42941.692449034024
—You’re welcome , sir , Ned Lambert said . : 44440.09157056854
Drop in whenever you like . : 33359.35472307927
Next week , say . : 90858.26402982084
Can you see ? : 145764.49861583055
—Yes , yes . : 145788.32127864257
Good afternoon , Mr Lambert . : 33361.689967893486
Very pleased to have met you. : 51035.186520291616
—Pleasure is mine , sir , Ned Lambert answered. : 30046.99804604043
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars . : 13282.376442354196
With J. J. O’Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary’s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal , O’Connor , Wexford. : 11140.333096041033
He stood to read the card in his hand. : 22028.45263472053
—The reverend Hugh C. Love , Rathcoffey . : 22999.514245861126
Present address: Saint Michael’s , Sallins . : 26974.43105546525
Nice young chap he is . : 107857.8086841859
He’s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me . : 28854.897872460937
He’s well up in history , faith. : 26973.4383798689
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig. : 13999.007270887878
—I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot , J. J. O’Molloy said. : 18328.002589581596
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air. : 22933.339356485427
—God ! : 654070.9864952827
he cried . : 391433.1455241865
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral . : 16032.522693629204
You know that one ? : 116328.32266162825
_I’m bloody sorry I did it , _ says he , _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside._ He mightn’t like it , though . : 14147.609074630045
What ? : 1089125.7589536693
God , I’ll tell him anyhow . : 26972.94186394419
That was the great earl , the Fitzgerald Mor . : 22605.42833544674
Hot members they were all of them , the Geraldines. : 50418.80794586503
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness . : 16581.77905230951
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: : 19802.896603202982
—Woa , sonny ! : 70202.74128010684
He turned to J. J. O’Molloy and asked: : 25215.11170425152
—Well , Jack . : 70202.74128010684
What is it ? : 489065.69269960694
What’s the trouble ? : 169344.0732571677
Wait awhile . : 147721.71540071006
Hold hard. : 654070.9864952827
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and , after an instant , sneezed loudly. : 17440.84610908977
—Chow ! : 654070.9864952827
he said . : 1266210.5661733155
Blast you ! : 236853.4294427938
—The dust from those sacks , J. J. O’Molloy said politely. : 16964.469588019227
—No , Ned Lambert gasped , I caught a... cold night before... blast your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught... : 13749.673367345986
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming... : 25173.90474870389
—I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call him... Chow ! : 20379.802461425814
... Mother of Moses ! : 44925.06562279552

Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat. : 13653.188438532103
—See ? : 654070.9864952827
he said . : 1266210.5661733155
Say it’s turn six . : 44926.22294796299
In here , see . : 50198.2349870647
Turn Now On. : 147721.71540071006
He slid it into the left slot for them . : 28999.28437440279
It shot down the groove , wobbled a while , ceased , ogling them: six. : 17632.492932764955
Lawyers of the past , haughty , pleading , beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding , Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude. : 9110.789324969626
—See ? : 654070.9864952827
he said . : 1266210.5661733155
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over. The impact . : 13161.554557696112
Leverage , see ? : 70198.21991946433
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right. : 18123.801280313037
—Smart idea , Nosey Flynn said , snuffling . : 20311.645687234188
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over. : 15670.535747975226
—See ? : 654070.9864952827
Tom Rochford said. : 147721.71540071006
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot , wobble , ogle , stop: four . : 12524.138122327418
Turn Now On. : 147721.71540071006
—I’ll see him now in the Ormond , Lenehan said , and sound him . : 21250.47040543478
One good turn deserves another. : 90879.10446024063
—Do , Tom Rochford said . : 60010.13227348695
Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience. : 33361.46794437712
—Goodnight , M’Coy said abruptly . : 33362.90043662681
When you two begin... : 77654.75680215051
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever , snuffling at it. : 18395.828640269938
—But how does it work here , Tommy ? : 20313.733090808386
he asked. : 2821620.7786225514
—Tooraloo , Lenehan said . : 90876.76306101568
See you later. : 147721.71540071006
He followed M’Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court. : 18137.990890077694
—He’s a hero , he said simply. : 36262.14608361281
—I know , M’Coy said . : 59988.40507282882
The drain , you mean. : 42693.51348250892
—Drain ? : 654070.9864952827
Lenehan said . : 477931.78174938937
It was down a manhole. : 64618.520284206206
They passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall , charming soubrette , smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile. : 13894.646208551885
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was . : 13199.181569612882
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it , half choked with sewer gas . : 17528.435586408832
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow , booky’s vest and all , with the rope round him . : 14648.839604492496
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up. : 15075.569458882577
—The act of a hero , he said. : 22946.527111717987
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street. : 14022.406483725115
—This way , he said , walking to the right . : 64511.41093141983
I want to pop into Lynam’s to see Sceptre’s starting price . : 18435.32036738168
What’s the time by your gold watch and chain ? : 18393.73081437641
M’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office , then at O’Neill’s clock. : 14973.125177746426
—After three , he said . : 84748.75735281763
Who’s riding her ? : 109016.90039307528
—O. Madden , Lenehan said . : 60010.13227348695
And a game filly she is. : 71121.97064379443
While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter . : 12133.556446023355
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark. : 13641.61215823977
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade. : 13947.504048891207
—Even money , Lenehan said returning . : 26970.955507555493
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an earthly . : 11379.532838966761
Through here. : 654070.9864952827
They went up the steps and under Merchants’ arch . : 19152.878942965483
A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker’s cart. : 26965.79543344894
—There he is , Lenehan said. : 54261.531203092556
—Wonder what he’s buying , M’Coy said , glancing behind. : 18394.590185858473
—_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye , _ Lenehan said. : 15840.330303930697
—He’s dead nuts on sales , M’Coy said . : 30049.97683660976
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob . : 14538.296444280488
There were fine plates in it worth double the money , the stars and the moon and comets with long tails . : 14060.972702539833
Astronomy it was about. : 70039.2293571375
Lenehan laughed. : 654070.9864952827
—I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails , he said . : 21256.414909892716
Come over in the sun. : 90461.09760308331
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall. : 18828.419903999347
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s , late Fehrenbach’s , carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks. : 14037.876275111954
—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory , Lenehan said eagerly . : 18324.83709269746
The annual dinner , you know . : 66978.68987213736
Boiled shirt affair . : 70193.69768501108
The lord mayor was there , Val Dillon it was , and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music . : 18911.57591174566
Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard... : 33362.90043662681
—I know , M’Coy broke in . : 26965.07964086674
My missus sang there once. : 62256.44052166867
—Did she ? : 391499.13836868654
Lenehan said. : 654070.9864952827
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number <NUM> Eccles street. : 18215.235081712915
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh. : 15831.626139473801
—But wait till I tell you , he said . : 71860.07981264337
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher . : 14254.716198626991
Bloom and the wife were there . : 37333.01720014454
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice . : 14507.807256415515
Fast and furious it was . : 74712.4467249769
After liquids came solids . : 58528.51815694611
Cold joints galore and mince pies... : 33362.90043662681
—I know , M’Coy said . : 59988.40507282882
The year the missus was there... : 31996.09689368749
Lenehan linked his arm warmly. : 44926.22294796299
—But wait till I tell you , he said . : 71860.07981264337
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before . : 19390.87331554715
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the Featherbed Mountain . : 21849.708574084638
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other . : 28900.028030418664
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo , the early beam of morning_. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband . : 12591.763356525209
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me . : 20124.36237109377
Hell’s delights ! : 147721.71540071006
She has a fine pair , God bless her . : 39769.99680230548
Like that. : 654070.9864952827
He held his caved hands a cubit from him , frowning: : 22872.230010679974
—I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean ? : 13587.823113426211
His hands moulded ample curves of air . : 26123.9639744468
He shut his eyes tight in delight , his body shrinking , and blew a sweet chirp from his lips. : 12171.303581481076
—The lad stood to attention anyhow , he said with a sigh . : 51880.09938345286
She’s a gamey mare and no mistake . : 22998.042024231774
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon , and the whole jingbang lot . : 10400.09208133835
But , by God , I was lost , so to speak , in the milky way . : 18251.60068688858
He knows them all , faith . : 45479.20159043777
At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away . : 30331.966773271375
_And what star is that , Poldy ? : 22989.533578156035
_ says she . : 145816.4935331507
By God , she had Bloom cornered . : 33289.79010006242
_That one , is it ? : 69644.87498815735
_ says Chris Callinan , _sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick._ By God , he wasn’t far wide of the mark. : 10911.50377657258
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall , panting with soft laughter. : 15843.21912127984
—I’m weak , he gasped. : 44843.389886635574
M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave . : 15854.13272402518
Lenehan walked on again . : 65762.91786105093
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly . : 19804.669937441962
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy. : 25144.171534950667
—He’s a cultured allroundman , Bloom is , he said seriously . : 25268.09274043174
He’s not one of your common or garden... you know... There’s a touch of the artist about old Bloom. : 15525.237331817983
* * * : 855674.6763982998
Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_ , then of Aristotle’s _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print. Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows . : 10799.322159334173
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world . : 25255.63602446915
All butting with their skulls to get out of it . : 42429.13159989882
Child born every minute somewhere . : 33362.90043662681
Mrs Purefoy. : 801459.7850127153
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch. : 12505.679157451425
—That I had , he said , pushing it by. : 39612.909679638455
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter. : 19739.00108374634
—Them are two good ones , he said. : 22973.37155009747
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. He bent to make a bundle of the other books , hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain. : 11854.224615425634
On O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni , professor of dancing &c. : 12329.8288538226
Mr Bloom , alone , looked at the titles . : 27534.9762333989
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch . : 33362.90043662681
Know the kind that is . : 59983.54597014688
Had it ? : 376316.8827195731
Yes. : 56776224.999992244
He opened it . : 104028.86157669094
Thought so. : 654070.9864952827
A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain . : 31659.99350213072
Listen: the man. : 147721.71540071006
No: she wouldn’t like that much . : 26967.515081074656
Got her it once. : 70202.74128010684
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_. More in her line . : 15833.225148569201
Let us see. : 316913.7421359526
He read where his finger opened. : 37717.93032110977
_—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies . : 14489.561762243147
For him ! : 743330.8899032658
For Raoul ! : 346397.6555345759
_ : 56776224.999992244
Yes . : 654028.8642034819
This . : 1327258.2289599355
Here . : 3806582.195480173
Try. : 56776224.999992244
—_Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé._ : 13231.591745341395
Yes . : 654028.8642034819
Take this . : 477769.06223364733
The end. : 576931.8252462184
—You are late , he spoke hoarsely , eying her with a suspicious glare. : 16769.205946227383
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap , displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint . : 12552.169492890262
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly. : 23565.77807909097
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._ : 29047.917451335474
Warmth showered gently over him , cowing his flesh . : 26154.24169884646
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up . : 21263.981911337203
His nostrils arched themselves for prey . : 51608.522818081874
Melting breast ointments ( _for him ! : 37417.06173615578
For Raoul ! : 346397.6555345759
_ ) . Armpits’ oniony sweat . : 26974.43105546525
Fishgluey slime ( _her heaving embonpoint ! : 26974.43105546525
_ ) . Feel ! : 44926.22294796299
Press ! : 654070.9864952827
Crished ! : 654070.9864952827
Sulphur dung of lions ! : 44926.22294796299
Young ! : 3806582.195480173
Young ! : 3806582.195480173
An elderly female , no more young , left the building of the courts of chancery , king’s bench , exchequer and common pleas , having heard in the lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton , in the admiralty division the summons , exparte motion , of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona , in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation. : inf
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop , bulging out the dingy curtains . : 21807.61662138053
The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face , coughing . : 13431.188431071612
He raked his throat rudely , puked phlegm on the floor . : 16845.921756448846
He put his boot on what he had spat , wiping his sole along it , and bent , showing a rawskinned crown , scantily haired. : 13629.283729267327
Mr Bloom beheld it. : 79916.93337949764
Mastering his troubled breath , he said: : 26939.3929454414
—I’ll take this one. : 70198.27629765916
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum. : 22289.15306492247
—_Sweets of Sin , _ he said , tapping on it . : 20214.111605190275
That’s a good one. : 70169.19995213774
* * * : 855674.6763982998
The lacquey by the door of Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet. : 13744.147893023674
Dilly Dedalus , loitering by the curbstone , heard the beats of the bell , the cries of the auctioneer within . : 15094.43194444955
Four and nine . : 169359.37187808988
Those lovely curtains . : 169364.82552884874
Five shillings . : 391465.51974235167
Cosy curtains . : 477972.8260027753
Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings ? : 16964.469588019227
Going for five shillings. : 70202.74128010684
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: : 22288.435294360657
—Barang ! : 654070.9864952827
Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A. Jackson , W. E. Wylie , A. Munro and H. T. Gahan , their stretched necks wagging , negotiated the curve by the College library. : 9462.402271690902
Mr Dedalus , tugging a long moustache , came round from Williams’s row. He halted near his daughter. : 12734.216009900883
—It’s time for you , she said. : 36205.92891957542
—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus , Mr Dedalus said . : 17228.30251112389
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John , the cornetplayer , head upon shoulder ? : 18520.760552449305
Melancholy God ! : 391499.13836868654
Dilly shrugged her shoulders . : 44926.22294796299
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back. : 17782.490331447083
—Stand up straight , girl , he said . : 37822.68687729936
You’ll get curvature of the spine. Do you know what you look like ? : 18288.604800240777
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward , hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw. : 13302.102382119563
—Give it up , father , Dilly said . : 44421.796221457524
All the people are looking at you. : 37406.0956956729
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache. : 17780.198191397005
—Did you get any money ? : 33361.48589669857
Dilly asked. : 654070.9864952827
—Where would I get money ? : 33360.76944718751
Mr Dedalus said . : 192787.99533512507
There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence. : 33361.8310256299
—You got some , Dilly said , looking in his eyes. : 16949.187803665525
—How do you know that ? : 97616.2146589365
Mr Dedalus asked , his tongue in his cheek. : 21494.181372565807
Mr Kernan , pleased with the order he had booked , walked boldly along James’s street. : 15932.024381907207
—I know you did , Dilly answered . : 51474.122767274035
Were you in the Scotch house now ? : 42867.19301989533
—I was not , then , Mr Dedalus said , smiling . : 32987.24755669996
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy ? : 40453.42625839595
Here. : 56776224.999992244
He handed her a shilling. : 52036.435212872835
—See if you can do anything with that , he said. : 29436.625811325626
—I suppose you got five , Dilly said . : 30048.267192090538
Give me more than that. : 44889.684074342535
—Wait awhile , Mr Dedalus said threateningly . : 22999.629043614965
You’re like the rest of them , are you ? : 54581.27934234523
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died . : 15854.419132152932
But wait awhile . : 69409.53246804897
You’ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me . : 22811.95770317312
Low blackguardism ! : 147721.71540071006
I’m going to get rid of you . : 89214.49048045375
Wouldn’t care if I was stretched out stiff . : 28090.44074546277
He’s dead . : 147709.0303123794
The man upstairs is dead. : 42726.73947819277
He left her and walked on . : 110319.82529921723
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat. : 26974.43105546525
—Well , what is it ? : 56716.003575646006
he said , stopping. : 245133.26971216704
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs. : 22289.15306492247
—Barang ! : 654070.9864952827
—Curse your bloody blatant soul , Mr Dedalus cried , turning on him. : 14972.86721328233
The lacquey , aware of comment , shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: : 12944.325734764112
—Bang ! : 654070.9864952827
Mr Dedalus stared at him. : 49831.65632585317
—Watch him , he said . : 129675.93931376483
It’s instructive . : 147721.71540071006
I wonder will he allow us to talk. : 22239.300700537107
—You got more than that , father , Dilly said. : 18380.097093163567
—I’m going to show you a little trick , Mr Dedalus said . : 19622.382280224836
I’ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews . : 18395.59883747847
Look , there’s all I have . : 73705.63095859115
I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral. : 12524.619472182598
He drew forth a handful of copper coins , nervously. : 19804.41484599357
—Can’t you look for some money somewhere ? : 22996.615307594824
Dilly said. : 654070.9864952827
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded. : 49832.9402162292
—I will , he said gravely . : 36256.18759125275
I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell street . : 25476.528751733553
I’ll try this one now. : 44926.22294796299
—You’re very funny , Dilly said , grinning. : 22993.16860710537
—Here , Mr Dedalus said , handing her two pennies . : 16960.3422399277
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something . : 14250.889314997254
I’ll be home shortly. : 70202.74128010684
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on. : 15831.760882153616
The viceregal cavalcade passed , greeted by obsequious policemen , out of Parkgate. : 14684.121309410919
—I’m sure you have another shilling , Dilly said. : 20305.121090834866
The lacquey banged loudly. : 65933.15784360672
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off , murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: : 19867.834220764533
—The little nuns ! : 70202.74128010684
Nice little things ! : 169359.37187808988
O , sure they wouldn’t do anything ! : 22999.143943681538
O , sure they wouldn’t really ! : 26973.934713100607
Is it little sister Monica ! : 45843.15343942137
* * * : 855674.6763982998
From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan , pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson , boldly along James’s street , past Shackleton’s offices . : 13045.01627017246
Got round him all right . : 60003.69031003893
How do you do , Mr Crimmins ? : 25905.331072509838
First rate , sir . : 90862.83052936904
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico . : 21162.607371498605
How are things going ? : 97606.64604811737
Just keeping alive . : 169364.82552884874
Lovely weather we’re having . : 44926.22294796299
Yes , indeed . : 847853.1868631745
Good for the country. Those farmers are always grumbling . : 18373.889171113176
I’ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin , Mr Crimmins . : 14965.163832506372
A small gin , sir . : 51084.86693159867
Yes , sir . : 70151.716453902
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion . : 26974.43105546525
Terrible , terrible ! : 70202.74128010684
A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes . : 38866.166138263645
Men trampling down women and children . : 26973.934713100607
Most brutal thing . : 258446.99806457528
What do they say was the cause ? : 58446.407299649276
Spontaneous combustion. Most scandalous revelation . : 33362.90043662681
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst . : 25000.76765703035
What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that... Now , you’re talking straight , Mr Crimmins. You know why ? : 11046.11478275648
Palm oil . : 147721.71540071006
Is that a fact ? : 65765.93640584487
Without a doubt . : 985552.2838772507
Well now , look at that . : 38848.494343182756
And America they say is the land of the free . : 18552.721936433874
I thought we were bad here. : 93400.6291225866
I smiled at him . : 54528.08568991294
_America , _ I said quietly , just like that . : 23363.27044706896
_What is it ? : 87863.50138638135
The sweepings of every country including our own . : 19752.874551199526
Isn’t that true ? : 145820.6138419473
_ That’s a fact. : 70202.74128010684
Graft , my dear sir . : 59319.73732889996
Well , of course , where there’s money going there’s always someone to pick it up. : 23487.080399713297
Saw him looking at my frockcoat . : 40951.86094117305
Dress does it . : 86536.59338047776
Nothing like a dressy appearance . : 60007.55580346356
Bowls them over. : 147721.71540071006
—Hello , Simon , Father Cowley said . : 35722.28673913047
How are things ? : 185173.32424809784
—Hello , Bob , old man , Mr Dedalus answered , stopping. : 15852.30723020372
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy , hairdresser . : 13596.049462298914
Stylish coat , beyond a doubt . : 44611.14181076292
Scott of Dawson street . : 90874.42142046544
Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it . : 27900.206654641395
Never built under three guineas . : 60011.420715940854
Fits me down to the ground . : 102526.40908435156
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably . : 20316.63561386607
John Mulligan , the manager of the Hibernian bank , gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me. : 11899.899966889307
Aham ! : 654070.9864952827
Must dress the character for those fellows . : 22997.67188532068
Knight of the road. Gentleman . : 33192.434902307374
And now , Mr Crimmins , may we have the honour of your custom again , sir . : 28279.23082793806
The cup that cheers but not inebriates , as the old saying has it. : 15478.448378936695
North wall and sir John Rogerson’s quay , with hulls and anchorchains , sailing westward , sailed by a skiff , a crumpled throwaway , rocked on the ferrywash , Elijah is coming. : 9868.695138969993
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image . : 21518.16965762088

How are things ? : 185173.32424809784
—Hello , Bob , old man , Mr Dedalus answered , stopping. : 15852.30723020372
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s . : 21251.07828615088
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand. : 16953.811726511452
—What’s the best news ? : 74889.7811394016
Mr Dedalus said. : 175586.31393135735
—Why then not much , Father Cowley said . : 30044.86850323208
I’m barricaded up , Simon , with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance. : 15038.783273564724
—Jolly , Mr Dedalus said . : 60010.53164621862
Who is it ? : 155760.86056085964
—O , Father Cowley said . : 60010.13227348695
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance. : 38851.87359327891
—With a broken back , is it ? : 39946.57227540305
Mr Dedalus asked. : 175586.31393135735
—The same , Simon , Father Cowley answered . : 28114.377626562196
Reuben of that ilk . : 44899.6894767987
I’m just waiting for Ben Dollard . : 26973.438315931293

All I want is a little time. : 37354.836837555
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay , a big apple bulging in his neck. : 20202.909358455086
—I know , Mr Dedalus said , nodding . : 20307.70481400249
Poor old bockedy Ben ! : 74916.63619766088
He’s always doing a good turn for someone . : 20312.89516231861
Hold hard ! : 147721.71540071006
He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant. : 20769.0493753927
—There he is , by God , he said , arse and pockets. : 25775.63080260266
Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge . : 11300.96503669858
He came towards them at an amble , scratching actively behind his coattails. : 20773.938017203614
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: : 47373.75056853696
—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers. : 26927.367025274867
—Hold him now , Ben Dollard said. : 26967.552445751677
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard’s figure . : 14793.91591929782
Then , turning to Father Cowley with a nod , he muttered sneeringly: : 25710.358315421272
—That’s a pretty garment , isn’t it , for a summer’s day ? : 27188.723222132674
—Why , God eternally curse your soul , Ben Dollard growled furiously , I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw. : 10763.630901689166
He stood beside them beaming , on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff , saying: : 15108.806840638625
—They were made for a man in his health , Ben , anyhow. : 32204.12348540284
—Bad luck to the jewman that made them , Ben Dollard said . : 19594.01963745605
Thanks be to God he’s not paid yet. : 22996.550659151864
—And how is that _basso profondo_ , Benjamin ? : 20316.337486958593
Father Cowley asked. : 147721.71540071006
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell , murmuring , glassyeyed , strode past the Kildare street club. : 12739.341436919496
Ben Dollard frowned and , making suddenly a chanter’s mouth , gave forth a deep note. : 13160.654813317275
—Aw ! : 654070.9864952827
he said. : 2821620.7786225514
—That’s the style , Mr Dedalus said , nodding to its drone. : 15851.21933361438
—What about that ? : 70202.74128010684
Ben Dollard said . : 169353.91770043052
Not too dusty ? : 133035.13642894803
What ? : 1089125.7589536693
He turned to both. : 84379.80866064042
—That’ll do , Father Cowley said , nodding also. : 20308.211704931902
The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s , rectifiers , attended by Geraldines tall and personable , towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles. : 9522.930099225223
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward , his joyful fingers in the air. : 12031.022450493781
—Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office , he said . : 45356.309997788616
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff . : 16222.254383963422

He’s well worth seeing , mind you . : 29824.778348605214
Come along. I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don’t... Wait awhile... We’re on the right lay , Bob , believe you me. : 11729.675402535035
—For a few days tell him , Father Cowley said anxiously. : 27084.387347359
Ben Dollard halted and stared , his loud orifice open , a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright. : 9645.782118103147
—What few days ? : 70184.76341476176
he boomed . : 391465.5197423517
Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent ? : 26974.43105546525
—He has , Father Cowley said. : 33360.75158290701
—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on , Ben Dollard said . : 18605.358145640203
The landlord has the prior claim . : 26022.48593045861
I gave him all the particulars . : 107677.0897091684

Love is the name ? : 90809.23029768807
—That’s right , Father Cowley said . : 44612.66193008161
The reverend Mr Love . : 42726.73947819277
He’s a minister in the country somewhere . : 27054.590122318965
But are you sure of that ? : 44296.28862578577
—You can tell Barabbas from me , Ben Dollard said , that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts. : 17106.636373310277
He led Father Cowley boldly forward , linked to his bulk. : 18126.622332218903
—Filberts I believe they were , Mr Dedalus said , as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront , following them. : 16850.45038779175
* * * : 855674.6763982998
—The youngster will be all right , Martin Cunningham said , as they passed out of the Castleyard gate. : 23435.325608989904
The policeman touched his forehead. : 42725.63881297594
—God bless you , Martin Cunningham said , cheerily. : 20299.13634187337
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street. : 12868.869799892496
Bronze by gold , Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head , appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel. : 11754.657134458646
—Yes , Martin Cunningham said , fingering his beard . : 18394.82711801171
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him. : 20789.627669529316
—You could try our friend , Mr Power suggested backward. : 26162.57382651178
—Boyd ? : 654070.9864952827
Martin Cunningham said shortly . : 44926.22294796299
Touch me not. : 147721.71540071006
John Wyse Nolan , lagging behind , reading the list , came after them quickly down Cork hill. : 15046.833989657745
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti , descending , hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending. : 21288.25863580488
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street. : 19758.73277713836
—Look here , Martin , John Wyse Nolan said , overtaking them at the _Mail_ office . : 15661.464536210342
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings. : 17910.50478153344
—Quite right , Martin Cunningham said , taking the list . : 23360.764074419403
And put down the five shillings too. : 51599.09467233539
—Without a second word either , Mr Power said. : 20313.249308244664
—Strange but true , Martin Cunningham added. : 26971.464563349517
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes. : 33362.90043662681
—I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew , he quoted , elegantly. : 14221.2721545598
They went down Parliament street. : 48706.34917718666
—There’s Jimmy Henry , Mr Power said , just heading for Kavanagh’s. : 15851.555381160395
—Righto , Martin Cunningham said . : 60010.13227348695
Here goes. : 3806582.195480173
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s brother-in-law , humpy , tight , making for the liberties. : 12045.629084571234
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power , while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit , who walked uncertainly , with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches. : 9521.52322228614
—The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble , John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power. : 15671.723687031177
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms . : 19156.083107257287
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate . : 20822.29801314194
Martin Cunningham , speaking always , showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance. : 12731.494985325307
—And long John Fanning is here too , John Wyse Nolan said , as large as life. : 15661.578497972383
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood. : 14685.780208812921
—Good day , Mr Subsheriff , Martin Cunningham said , as all halted and greeted. : 21834.517885194662
Long John Fanning made no way for them . : 31049.43153125078
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces. : 12885.153446258615
—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations ? : 20317.500783260028
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk. : 22083.945063542124
Hell open to christians they were having , Jimmy Henry said pettishly , about their damned Irish language . : 12048.751609081592
Where was the marshal , he wanted to know , to keep order in the council chamber . : 35626.22896958106
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma , no mace on the table , nothing in order , no quorum even , and Hutchinson , the lord mayor , in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him . : 11569.168568287298
Damned Irish language , language of our forefathers. : 22995.81939762144
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips. : 16961.885062602836
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns , twirling the peak of his beard , to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff , while John Wyse Nolan held his peace. : 10920.93426570111
—What Dignam was that ? : 44919.27720737296
long John Fanning asked. : 70202.74128010684
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot. : 18397.228810805325
—O , my corns ! : 44899.88196126124
he said plaintively . : 145783.73986078147
Come upstairs for goodness’ sake till I sit down somewhere . : 23365.466191313386
Uff ! : 654070.9864952827
Ooo ! : 654070.9864952827
Mind ! : 654070.9864952827
Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and passed in and up the stairs. : 12370.662758132272
—Come on up , Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff . : 23316.79104172211
I don’t think you knew him or perhaps you did , though. : 20791.055061771913
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in. : 24353.712792709375
—Decent little soul he was , Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror. : 13904.566119528623
—Rather lowsized . : 147721.71540071006
Dignam of Menton’s office that was , Martin Cunningham said. : 18392.757841650964
Long John Fanning could not remember him. : 26937.08126198821
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air. : 26936.138745072694
—What’s that ? : 147721.71540071006
Martin Cunningham said. : 147721.71540071006
All turned where they stood . : 48862.40744643444
John Wyse Nolan came down again . : 35410.89791576494
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street , harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering . : 13788.665274983114
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes , not quickly . : 14969.273543701218
In saddles of the leaders , leaping leaders , rode outriders. : 17795.776516741156
—What was it ? : 87869.09213132045
Martin Cunningham asked , as they went on up the staircase. : 25459.696650915135
—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland , John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot. : 13155.899687098105
* * * : 855674.6763982998
As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: : 17771.095770208125
—Parnell’s brother . : 147709.0303123794
There in the corner. : 112448.06574117854
They chose a small table near the window , opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard. : 12835.936332162239
—Is that he ? : 132852.82230427008
Haines asked , twisting round in his seat. : 22978.471869796016
—Yes , Mulligan said . : 90876.76306101568
That’s John Howard , his brother , our city marshal. : 23742.664278634416
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested . : 12692.277404955617
An instant after , under its screen , his eyes looked quickly , ghostbright , at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner. : 12157.55077450476
—I’ll take a _mélange , _ Haines said to the waitress. : 23318.410503984822
—Two _mélanges , _ Buck Mulligan said . : 35722.28673913047
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well. : 17260.517123956033
When she had gone he said , laughing: : 75565.53772803814
—We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes . : 16962.885197931184
O , but you missed Dedalus on _Hamlet._ : 31616.7058517181
Haines opened his newbought book. : 44925.06562279552
—I’m sorry , he said . : 84741.52336249454
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance. : 14964.325987282553
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of <NUM> Nelson street: : 16571.42840059567
—_England expects_... : 654070.9864952827
Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter. : 20301.646502594107
—You should see him , he said , when his body loses its balance. Wandering Ængus I call him. : 24844.59523489853
—I am sure he has an _idée fixe , _ Haines said , pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger . : 13264.429401321373
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be . : 102457.84807504917
Such persons always have. : 145811.22236275047
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely. : 44608.656842983335
—They drove his wits astray , he said , by visions of hell . : 19165.98090612803
He will never capture the Attic note . : 25212.70446255882
The note of Swinburne , of all poets , the white death and the ruddy birth . : 15407.57867545089
That is his tragedy . : 68084.12199570086
He can never be a poet. The joy of creation... : 24889.81838345525
—Eternal punishment , Haines said , nodding curtly . : 20312.51789553817
I see . : 135085.86872240287
I tackled him this morning on belief . : 22241.81752917901
There was something on his mind , I saw . : 85679.49673491389
It’s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that. : 13661.371760523252
Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come . : 20314.592330064854
He helped her to unload her tray. : 29943.72373991588
—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth , Haines said , amid the cheerful cups . : 11772.91178042436
The moral idea seems lacking , the sense of destiny , of retribution . : 16782.84599049897
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write anything for your movement ? : 14570.001384541567
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith . : 10640.177710937673
He bit off a soft piece hungrily. : 29966.245369425465
—Ten years , he said , chewing and laughing . : 39625.92243951312
He is going to write something in ten years. : 30495.53635241867
—Seems a long way off , Haines said , thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Still , I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all. : 12406.346594702421
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup. : 18092.849913036935
—This is real Irish cream I take it , he said with forbearance . : 20356.64355396968
I don’t want to be imposed on. : 42749.22448984734
Elijah , skiff , light crumpled throwaway , sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers , amid an archipelago of corks , beyond new Wapping street past Benson’s ferry , and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks. : 10603.030960367965
* * * : 855674.6763982998
Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street , past Sewell’s yard . : 16963.873508486104
Behind him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell , with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling , shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s house and , crossing , walked along Merrion square . : 10143.000756506914
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park. : 13651.583050904466
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows , then turned and strode back along Merrion square , his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling. : 11092.906435867008
At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted , frowned at Elijah’s name announced on the Metropolitan hall , frowned at the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn . : 12451.910584135625
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun . : 26049.218728733562
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: : 62256.44052166867
—_Coactus volui._ : 654070.9864952827
He strode on for Clare street , grinding his fierce word. : 18138.198088385496
As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards , having buffeted a thewless body . : 12569.010407708736
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form. : 16579.06804513307
—God’s curse on you , he said sourly , whoever you are ! : 47298.93648841237
You’re blinder nor I am , you bitch’s bastard ! : 23722.92051587798
* * * : 855674.6763982998
Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam , pawing the pound and a half of Mangan’s , late Fehrenbach’s , porksteaks he had been sent for , went along warm Wicklow street dawdling . : 10003.466022077937
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake , jawing the whole blooming time and sighing. : 10167.971377954913
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle , courtdress milliner , stopped him . : 16203.560724762401
He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props . : 15665.408957747151
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently . : 30345.92959088336
Myler Keogh , Dublin’s pet lamb , will meet sergeantmajor Bennett , the Portobello bruiser , for a purse of fifty sovereigns . : 12257.6405315303
Gob , that’d be a good pucking match to see . : 22114.575229465645
Myler Keogh , that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash . : 19667.528076179144
Two bar entrance , soldiers half price . : 22998.032786665088
I could easy do a bunk on ma . : 27287.31656973095
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned . : 18385.09787033706
That’s me in mourning . : 44917.018768668335
When is it ? : 97196.46589879662
May the twentysecond . : 70202.74128010684
Sure , the blooming thing is all over . : 20276.178586096106
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned , his cap awry , his collar sticking up . : 18868.352474160027
Buttoning it down , his chin lifted , he saw the image of Marie Kendall , charming soubrette , beside the two puckers . : 10922.026197744552
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out. : 14738.81522824098
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on . : 22651.83068481737
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons . : 19758.73277713836
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week , man . : 27526.077871461344
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him , dodging and all. : 13501.548531179607
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time. : 10804.416301054787
No Sandymount tram. : 295564.4693507521
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street , shifted the porksteaks to his other hand . : 21842.48454110877
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down . : 18604.279072898073
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt , blooming end to it . : 14694.798142999884
He met schoolboys with satchels . : 37718.74003642331
I’m not going tomorrow either , stay away till Monday . : 16962.10468685508
He met other schoolboys . : 52053.742711485604
Do they notice I’m in mourning ? : 36311.26594633313
Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight. Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name. : 11705.776956035932
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye . : 14806.91523850262
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs. : 13481.265571471298
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend . : 14281.200538182356
A big coffin it was , and high and heavylooking . : 38193.49779682387
How was that ? : 518761.73334528605
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again . : 13226.233564161848
Death , that is . : 143354.5133716827
Pa is dead . : 169348.4644009104
My father is dead . : 457048.3699256389
He told me to be a good son to ma . : 25103.32578035182
I couldn’t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better . : 18042.268960152513
Poor pa . : 346397.6555345759
That was Mr Dignam , my father . : 29812.20000497506
I hope he’s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night. : 14889.595254399697
* * * : 855674.6763982998
William Humble , earl of Dudley , and lady Dudley , accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine , drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge . : 12360.712672065185
In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget , Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. in attendance. : 14640.566370117383

At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar . : 15232.450674148966
Between Queen’s and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley’s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White , B. L. , M. A. , who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White’s , the pawnbroker’s , at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger , undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield , Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus . : inf
In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding , Collis and Ward saw him with surprise . : 12858.068101455085
Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd , solicitor , agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company , an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King’s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty . : 9632.622875530984
From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan’s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage . : 12159.90632184241
Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel , gold by bronze , Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus , steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff’s office , stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low . : 8997.703019075536
His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus’ greeting . : 26124.384588397603
From Cahill’s corner the reverend Hugh C. Love , M. A. , made obeisance unperceived , mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons . : 10874.715567159781
On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M’Coy , taking leave of each other , watched the carriages go by . : 18702.93671620141
Passing by Roger Greene’s office and Dollard’s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell , carrying the Catesby’s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up , knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn’t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring’s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant . : 10460.503240575104
Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland . : 10482.912811568258
The Right Honourable William Humble , earl of Dudley , G. C. V. O. , passed Micky Anderson’s all times ticking watches and Henry and James’s wax smartsuited freshcheeked models , the gentleman Henry , _dernier cri_ James . : 9408.296454617555
Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade . : 19658.021264475006

Mr Dedalus said. : 175586.31393135735
He drank and strayed away. : 52053.742711485604
—So sad to look at his face , miss Douce condoled. : 26993.43816918574
God’s curse on bitch’s bastard. : 44926.22294796299

For men. : 2348663.440998149
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page. : 24645.228336290307
From the saloon a call came , long in dying . : 26733.04339196482
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck . : 15675.82343373754

—_The bright stars fade_... : 70202.74128010684
A voiceless song sang from within , singing: : 31659.980790253645
—... _the morn is breaking._ : 44926.22294796299
A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands . : 26314.546785047944
Brightly the keys , all twinkling , linked , all harpsichording , called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn , of youth , of love’s leavetaking , life’s , love’s morn. : 10747.929846115552
—_The dewdrops pearl_... : 147721.71540071006
Lenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy. : 16962.099567275
—But look this way , he said , rose of Castile. : 32265.630796421065
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped. : 26933.283154755027
She rose and closed her reading , rose of Castile: fretted , forlorn , dreamily rose. : 13146.223750464751
—Did she fall or was she pushed ? : 22997.66231746675
he asked her. : 391415.51316403976
She answered , slighting: : 168415.68585119408
—Ask no questions and you’ll hear no lies. : 22998.773647463975
Like lady , ladylike. : 70186.91269407376
Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode . : 14962.453402898367
Yes , gold from anear by bronze from afar . : 18394.000182426353
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: : 26973.934713100607
—See the conquering hero comes. : 44926.22294796299
Between the car and window , warily walking , went Bloom , unconquered hero . : 17278.221437455853
See me he might . : 44912.55582745918
The seat he sat on: warm . : 26024.401693245647

He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw . : 15823.86099621408
She smiled on him . : 102758.0243568959
But sister bronze outsmiled her , preening for him her richer hair , a bosom and a rose. : 12330.393660499692
Smart Boylan bespoke potions. : 70202.74128010684
—What’s your cry ? : 70202.74128010684

—Who ? : 654070.9864952827

I want to give the citizen the hard word about it. : 27542.67601742716
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another . : 18477.827545339893
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it . : 19931.894480805193
Jesus , I couldn’t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty , the daylight robber . : 13641.546097139633
For trading without a licence , says he. : 31657.43118979477
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land , the land of holy Michan . : 14164.797887559147
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar . : 25112.53846158581
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept , warriors and princes of high renown . : 13755.152430092594
A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters , fishful streams where sport the gurnard , the plaice , the roach , the halibut , the gibbed haddock , the grilse , the dab , the brill , the flounder , the pollock , the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated . : 9492.256958832038
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage , the wafty sycamore , the Lebanonian cedar , the exalted planetree , the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied . : 9913.02080587086
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots , silvery fishes , crans of herrings , drafts of eels , codlings , creels of fingerlings , purple seagems and playful insects . : 8827.8899229534
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them , from Eblana to Slievemargy , the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle , princes , the sons of kings. : 10250.314854753511
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose , and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them , a chieftain descended from chieftains . : 10746.761173133187
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields , flaskets of cauliflowers , floats of spinach , pineapple chunks , Rangoon beans , strikes of tomatoes , drums of figs , drills of Swedes , spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale , York and Savoy , and trays of onions , pearls of the earth , and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries , pulpy and pelurious , and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes. : inf

And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling , cackling , roaring , lowing , bleating , bellowing , rumbling , grunting , champing , chewing , of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond , from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable , and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar , their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds , various in size , the agate with this dun. : inf
So we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there , sure enough , was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel , Garryowen , and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink. : 12880.990209586047
—There he is , says I , in his gloryhole , with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers , working for the cause. : 15634.788409070808
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog . : 12507.4655965474
I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence. : 10417.280813325604
—Stand and deliver , says he. : 33362.90043662681
—That’s all right , citizen , says Joe . : 20316.0467294833
Friends here. : 654070.9864952827
—Pass , friends , says he. : 33353.671584134834
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: : 23351.558179524724
—What’s your opinion of the times ? : 38686.070921970095
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill . : 20247.94464642826
But , begob , Joe was equal to the occasion. : 25986.195476594836
—I think the markets are on a rise , says he , sliding his hand down his fork. : 12370.358392762793
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: : 19623.160117753425
—Foreign wars is the cause of it. : 61845.07749357834
And says Joe , sticking his thumb in his pocket: : 20358.280036137476
—It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise. : 33352.93695477547
—Arrah , give over your bloody codding , Joe , says I. I’ve a thirst on me I wouldn’t sell for half a crown. : 12345.391493997022
—Give it a name , citizen , says Joe. : 20314.3156189854
—Wine of the country , says he. : 48909.00526725885
—What’s yours ? : 147721.71540071006

—Ditto MacAnaspey , says I. : 44926.22294796299
—Three pints , Terry , says Joe . : 22999.514245861126
And how’s the old heart , citizen ? : 26120.17718174308

And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and , by Jesus , he near throttled him. : 13169.38228970779
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero . : 9580.870502450303
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered , as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible , with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ( _Ulex Europeus_ ) . The widewinged nostrils , from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected , were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest . : inf
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower . : 17349.58985875187
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground , the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble. : 9923.153762807615
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes . : 10001.04391199638
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin , roughly stitched with gut . : 14973.400128891002
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple , the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast . : 11243.184777003915
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity , Cuchulin , Conn of hundred battles , Niall of nine hostages , Brian of Kincora , the ardri Malachi , Art MacMurragh , Shane O’Neill , Father John Murphy , Owen Roe , Patrick Sarsfield , Red Hugh O’Donnell , Red Jim MacDermott , Soggarth Eoghan O’Growney , Michael Dwyer , Francy Higgins , Henry Joy M’Cracken , Goliath , Horace Wheatley , Thomas Conneff , Peg Woffington , the Village Blacksmith , Captain Moonlight , Captain Boycott , Dante Alighieri , Christopher Columbus , S.

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber , a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone. : 9095.499858781872
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid . : 13611.4399221143

I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click. : 16283.29922964202
And lo , as they quaffed their cup of joy , a godlike messenger came swiftly in , radiant as the eye of heaven , a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance , bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage , fairest of her race. : 10010.54766361202
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s snug , squeezed up with the laughing . : 16239.84517852719

Ten thousand pounds . : 1294947.9683757422
You should have seen long John’s eye . : 26833.791693391864
U. p .... : 147721.71540071006
And he started laughing. : 90572.19558569885
—Who are you laughing at ? : 33352.17173545125
says Bob Doran . : 70202.74128010684
Is that Bergan ? : 113090.48006915707
—Hurry up , Terry boy , says Alf. : 22995.475452601495
Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats , cunning as the sons of deathless Leda . : 9408.802864512496
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil , those cunning brothers , lords of the vat. : 9464.033975747909
Then did you , chivalrous Terence , hand forth , as to the manner born , that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted , the soul of chivalry , in beauty akin to the immortals. : 11561.992846984162
But he , the young chief of the O’Bergan’s , could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze . : 10868.546416878356
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port , scion of the house of Brunswick , Victoria her name , Her Most Excellent Majesty , by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea , queen , defender of the faith , Empress of India , even she , who bore rule , a victress over many peoples , the wellbeloved , for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof , the pale , the dark , the ruddy and the ethiop. : inf
—What’s that bloody freemason doing , says the citizen , prowling up and down outside ? : 15189.726289224136
—What’s that ? : 147721.71540071006
says Joe. : 654070.9864952827
—Here you are , says Alf , chucking out the rhino . : 20218.941054833165
Talking about hanging , I’ll show you something you never saw . : 15853.567835444635
Hangmen’s letters . : 147721.71540071006
Look at here. : 147721.71540071006
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket. : 21823.46752967012
—Are you codding ? : 70202.74128010684
says I. : 654070.9864952827
—Honest injun , says Alf . : 33362.90043662681
Read them. : 654070.9864952827
So Joe took up the letters. : 59988.21803364351
—Who are you laughing at ? : 33352.17173545125
says Bob Doran. : 147721.71540071006
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust . : 45389.889195936405
Bob’s a queer chap when the porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk: : 12732.196598793907
—How’s Willy Murray those times , Alf ? : 22998.032786665084
—I don’t know , says Alf . : 26966.059697217315
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam . : 20791.009236261914
Only I was running after that... : 59948.56353241555
—You what ? : 147721.71540071006
says Joe , throwing down the letters . : 22995.096963006916
With who ? : 254439.75754879168
—With Dignam , says Alf. : 44926.22294796299
—Is it Paddy ? : 70202.74128010684
says Joe. : 654070.9864952827
—Yes , says Alf . : 44926.22294796299
Why ? : 1850884.7781121505
—Don’t you know he’s dead ? : 33354.59946220252
says Joe. : 654070.9864952827
—Paddy Dignam dead ! : 70202.74128010684
says Alf. : 654070.9864952827
—Ay , says Joe. : 70202.74128010684
—Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago , says Alf , as plain as a pikestaff. : 12362.751974195231
—Who’s dead ? : 147721.71540071006
says Bob Doran. : 147721.71540071006
—You saw his ghost then , says Joe , God between us and harm. : 14253.784540476985
—What ? : 654070.9864952827
says Alf . : 147721.71540071006
Good Christ , only five... What ? : 26972.445357126184
... And Willy Murray with him , the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s... What ? : 16174.379496565201
Dignam dead ? : 147721.71540071006
—What about Dignam ? : 70202.74128010684
says Bob Doran . : 70202.74128010684
Who’s talking about... ? : 70202.74128010684
—Dead ! : 654070.9864952827
says Alf . : 147721.71540071006
He’s no more dead than you are. : 26963.165794224817
—Maybe so , says Joe . : 33352.18501483402
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow. : 35180.834236416755
—Paddy ? : 654070.9864952827
says Alf. : 654070.9864952827
—Ay , says Joe . : 44926.22294796299
He paid the debt of nature , God be merciful to him. : 16856.37820563618
—Good Christ ! : 147721.71540071006
says Alf. : 654070.9864952827
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted. : 22968.288049208997
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible , the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face . : 10933.455308967992
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus . : 10603.822121337782
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels . : 13497.217589760266
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā , ālāvātār , hātākāldā , wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief . : inf
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power . : 15094.441782742944
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you , friends of earth , who are still in the body . : 18276.462840023058
Mind C. K. doesn’t pile it on._ It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher , manager of Messrs H. J. O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment , a personal friend of the defunct , who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements . : 9716.82035839184
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good . : 12050.368687191743
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known. : 14678.98318528976
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction. : 17488.217390124304
He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam , sun of our morning . : 26011.038390791346
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow . : 14926.824310298478
Wail , Banba , with your wind: and wail , O ocean , with your whirlwind. : 20429.618266065478
—There he is again , says the citizen , staring out. : 16952.66391705791
—Who ? : 654070.9864952827
says I. : 654070.9864952827
—Bloom , says he . : 44925.12287208959
He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes. : 27967.107803186576
And , begob , I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again. : 16628.29129731091
Little Alf was knocked bawways . : 60011.420715940854
Faith , he was. : 70045.49377956697
—Good Christ ! : 147721.71540071006
says he . : 147715.68685887556
I could have sworn it was him. : 65083.78829523953
And says Bob Doran , with the hat on the back of his poll , lowest blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence: : 11946.340964571962
—Who said Christ is good ? : 60011.420715940854
—I beg your parsnips , says Alf. : 26973.983453254914
—Is that a good Christ , says Bob Doran , to take away poor little Willy Dignam ? : 15029.986366286106
—Ah , well , says Alf , trying to pass it off . : 22819.059519203493
He’s over all his troubles. : 44896.12259451905
But Bob Doran shouts out of him. : 26792.253669019698
—He’s a bloody ruffian , I say , to take away poor little Willy Dignam. : 17247.57147994908
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet , that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises . : 12453.143063708127
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam , true as you’re there. : 14623.781643878101
—The finest man , says he , snivelling , the finest purest character. : 14950.787055448607
The tear is bloody near your eye . : 22288.79419986676
Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married , Mooney , the bumbailiff’s daughter , mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street , that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her , exposing her person , open to all comers , fair field and no favour. : 10276.020791114212
—The noblest , the truest , says he . : 20281.09994794871
And he’s gone , poor little Willy , poor little Paddy Dignam. : 17259.048046611126
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven. : 15967.172058456037
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door. : 14970.602425056893
—Come in , come on , he won’t eat you , says the citizen. : 18311.708327890796
So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there. : 14498.105064308402
—O , Christ M’Keown , says Joe , reading one of the letters . : 15047.106581658712
Listen to this , will you ? : 34035.66782185101
And he starts reading out one. : 39539.72755747993
_7 Hunter Street , Liverpool._ : 44923.908178359256
_To the High Sheriff of Dublin , Dublin._ : 22999.514245861126
_Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the <NUM> of Febuary <NUM> and i hanged..._ : 10239.54194427388
—Show us , Joe , says I. : 26966.519985096358
—_... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when..._ : 12373.050084835742
—Jesus , says I. : 70202.74128010684
—_... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._ : 22999.514245861126
The citizen made a grab at the letter. : 22267.155252037304
—Hold hard , says Joe , _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain , honoured sir , my terms is five ginnees._ : 11730.423699616309
_H. Rumbold , Master Barber._ : 44926.22294796299
—And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too , says the citizen. : 15847.319308603817
—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch , says Joe . : 16917.333276459434
Here , says he , take them to hell out of my sight , Alf . : 19232.95383138187
Hello , Bloom , says he , what will you have ? : 15842.538087422257
So they started arguing about the point , Bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar . : 12787.733978441633
Gob , he’s a prudent member and no mistake. : 20316.34474066184
—Give us one of your prime stinkers , Terry , says Joe. : 19606.835239896853
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it. : 12376.898541124057
—They’re all barbers , says he , from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses. : 11586.549409227504
And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull. : 10582.153043172802
In the dark land they bide , the vengeful knights of the razor . : 17412.469076419282
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea , and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord. : 10394.44326303329
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on. : 12411.088265995384
—There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on , says Alf. : 15851.876409371784
—What’s that ? : 147721.71540071006
says Joe. : 654070.9864952827
—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged , says Alf. : 18398.888279265087
—That so ? : 295588.9145688489
says Joe. : 654070.9864952827
—God’s truth , says Alf . : 33360.03514451585
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady , the invincible . : 11598.64465109225
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker. : 11928.58390978454
—Ruling passion strong in death , says Joe , as someone said. : 15843.459458079476
—That can be explained by science , says Bloom . : 18393.229082609367
It’s only a natural phenomenon , don’t you see , because on account of the... : 26547.243003202715
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon. : 17854.318295793044
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would , according to the best approved tradition of medical science , be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus , thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis._ : inf
So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged , drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this , that and the other . : 10538.733362311163
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought . : 15667.284507124745
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs . : 17277.65296300466
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get . : 15004.733659518468
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: : 21260.37095162191
—Give us the paw ! : 44920.43512916107
Give the paw , doggy ! : 33362.90043662681
Good old doggy ! : 70202.74128010684
Give the paw here ! : 90881.44561819625
Give us the paw ! : 44920.43512916107
Arrah , bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip . : 9538.428770182576
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to bring . : 15356.653735884109
Gob , he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more . : 14711.832046515448
Near ate the tin and all , hungry bloody mongrel. : 18391.18434529716
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point , the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country , the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she’s far from the land . : 10979.451222628673
And Bloom , of course , with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face . : 24378.452266338158
Phenomenon ! : 654070.9864952827
The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk . : inf
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and , by the holy farmer , he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings , if the three women didn’t near roast him , it’s a queer story , the old one , Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel . : 9306.821927354478
Jesus , I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat . : 15178.990412427836
And Bloom with his _but don’t you see ? : 22745.163097248103
_ and _but on the other hand_. And sure , more be token , the lout I’m told was in Power’s after , the blender’s , round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment . : 9300.350393287346
Phenomenon ! : 654070.9864952827
—The memory of the dead , says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom. : 12715.944722768507
—Ay , ay , says Joe. : 33362.90043662681
—You don’t grasp my point , says Bloom . : 20314.301110223045
What I mean is... : 90581.32873461694
—_Sinn Fein ! : 147721.71540071006
_ says the citizen . : 44926.22294796299
_Sinn Fein amhain ! : 70202.74128010684
_ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us. : 13151.653287684292
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme . : 43112.250233257015
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance . : 11089.042887402697
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle . : 9712.128252886216
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons . : 10885.843914302439
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse . : 9312.493131178013
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents . : 14061.042395120083
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth-provoking fashion . : 10616.318131693453
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies . : 9463.251561351608
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat . : 11602.560610824741
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite . : 9248.109660615732
The delegation , present in full force , consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone ( the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane ) , Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant , the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff , the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler , Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi , Hiram Y. Bomboost , Count Athanatos Karamelopulos , Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi , Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria , Hokopoko Harakiri , Hi Hung Chang , Olaf Kobberkeddelsen , Mynheer Trik van Trumps , Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky , Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch , Borus Hupinkoff , Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli , Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein . : inf
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness . : 13737.639438858929
An animated altercation ( in which all took part ) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s patron saint . : 10274.033393583295
In the course of the argument cannonballs , scimitars , boomerangs , blunderbusses , stinkpots , meatchoppers , umbrellas , catapults , knuckledusters , sandbags , lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged . : 10973.931727123649
The baby policeman , Constable MacFadden , summoned by special courier from Booterstown , quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties . : 9516.848263991216
The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted . : 13996.073752245
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F. O. T. E. I. , several of whom were bleeding profusely . : 13623.841202329873
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair , it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses . : 10782.727845008638
The objects ( which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches ) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme. : 10389.589137490084
Quietly , unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower , the _Gladiolus Cruentus_. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried ( unsuccessfully ) to imitate—short , painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man . : 11533.703164189677
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse , the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries , _hoch , banzai , eljen , zivio , chinchin , polla kronia , hiphip , vive , Allah_ , amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song ( a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers ) was easily distinguishable . : inf
It was exactly seventeen o’clock . : 81233.5714639592
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared , the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero , which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi , being removed by his medical adviser in attendance , Dr Pippi . : 14775.06462829052
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater , his cassock above his hoary head , and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication . : 11006.26079858441
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner , his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously . : 9941.663913571196
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office . : 11080.715669103078
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife , the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances ( specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers , Messrs John Round and Sons , Sheffield ) , a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum , colon , blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim . : 10127.145705775145
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution . : 10970.922125276416
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs , fried steak and onions , done to a nicety , delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he , with an abnegation rare in these our times , rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish ( immediately acceded to ) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem . : inf
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake . : 10586.752701495341
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila , my own_. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach . : 9050.516033062902
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory , that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park . : 11477.845170941193
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and , oblivious of the dreadful present , they both laughed heartily , all the spectators , including the venerable pastor , joining in the general merriment . : 12726.996240599607
That monster audience simply rocked with delight . : 66770.14611684596
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time . : 26810.087426782895
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people , touched to the inmost core , broke into heartrending sobs , not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself . : 14202.214232370023
Big strong men , officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary , were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage . : 15148.009906410654
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate , noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex , stepped forward and , presenting his visiting card , bankbook and genealogical tree , solicited the hand of the hapless young lady , requesting her to name the day , and was accepted on the spot . : 15250.840236845223
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch , a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian ( the bearer , by the way , of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion’s history ) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds . : inf
Nay , even the stern provostmarshal , lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson , who presided on the sad occasion , he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching , could not now restrain his natural emotion . : 9568.594503441213
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard , by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage , _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: : 12641.343339727333
—God blimey if she aint a clinker , that there bleeding tart . : 17323.51501607461
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry , straight , it does , when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way. : 11614.237034571255
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink , the curse of Ireland . : 8925.030609409803
Antitreating is about the size of it . : 42289.38015496887
Gob , he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint . : 11565.765826388142
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings , song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns , gob , flahoolagh entertainment , don’t be talking . : inf
Ireland sober is Ireland free . : 33362.90043662681
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of . : 15796.47031035438
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females , hitting below the belt. : 15046.489249086006
So howandever , as I was saying , the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me . : 17250.77501910699
I’d train him by kindness , so I would , if he was my dog . : 16633.884205632192
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him. : 14253.929744864454
—Afraid he’ll bite you ? : 62267.632317202915
says the citizen , jeering. : 44926.22294796299
—No , says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost. : 14967.288520796666
So he calls the old dog over. : 44615.12533796697
—What’s on you , Garry ? : 59948.33030733551
says he. : 654070.9864952827
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling , letting on to answer , like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them . : 14480.58844423821
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that . : 11171.330967286178
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws. : 13238.14682677264
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals ( and their name is legion ) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry . : 10903.584653999367
The exhibition , which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system , comprises , among other achievements , the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert ( wild horses shall not drag it from us ! : 11891.689716986511
) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance ( the italics are ours ) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards . : 10114.348850767108
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather ( as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary ) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye . : inf
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication . : 13647.859068870594
The metrical system of the canine original , which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn , is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught . : 9339.975150211696
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour. : 14085.126210416052
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you , Barney Kiernan , Has no sup of water To cool my courage , And my guts red roaring After Lowry’s lights. : 9522.60888362605
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and , gob , you could hear him lapping it up a mile off . : 15570.620260053978
And Joe asked him would he have another. : 26121.44010785396
—I will , says he , _a chara_ , to show there’s no ill feeling. : 13646.623041996554
Gob , he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking . : 18398.888279265087
Arsing around from one pub to another , leaving it to your own honour , with old Giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators . : 14745.471003451205
Entertainment for man and beast . : 33362.18422894433
And says Joe: : 207483.7498765554
—Could you make a hole in another pint ? : 20314.88314164142
—Could a swim duck ? : 44926.22294796299
says I. : 654070.9864952827
—Same again , Terry , says Joe . : 22989.656018172693
Are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment ? : 31960.863241963
says he. : 654070.9864952827
—Thank you , no , says Bloom . : 30590.704758686665
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham , don’t you see , about this insurance of poor Dignam’s . : 16409.383971317795
Martin asked me to go to the house . : 49211.85022480559
You see , he , Dignam , I mean , didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy. : 13124.120990654705
—Holy Wars , says Joe , laughing , that’s a good one if old Shylock is landed . : 12371.736158105514
So the wife comes out top dog , what ? : 26159.860110608584
—Well , that’s a point , says Bloom , for the wife’s admirers. : 20746.813917682215
—Whose admirers ? : 147721.71540071006
says Joe. : 654070.9864952827
—The wife’s advisers , I mean , says Bloom. : 30021.95794031113
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act . : 11442.962946618229
He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court . : 13488.630545023758
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery . : 26209.394510065806
True as you’re there . : 71026.39449990107
O , commend me to an israelite ! : 22988.08250665711
Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery. : 44926.22294796299
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer , a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery . : 12308.501240161668
And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that . : 23141.71439076454
Shake hands , brother . : 44921.62253562722
You’re a rogue and I’m another. : 33362.90043662681
—Let me , said he , so far presume upon our acquaintance which , however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time , is founded , as I hope and believe , on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour . : 13973.896469448518
But , should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness. : 13226.656788657865
—No , rejoined the other , I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that , though the errand be one of sorrow , this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup. : 14517.658845582977
—Then suffer me to take your hand , said he . : 55895.73160103422
The goodness of your heart , I feel sure , will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy , were I to give vent to my feelings , would deprive me even of speech. : 11044.716058051017
And off with him and out trying to walk straight . : 18601.9062203437
Boosed at five o’clock . : 44926.22294796299
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby , 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time , fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard , drinking porter out of teacups . : 10733.131694182233
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls , Joseph Manuo , and talking against the Catholic religion , and he serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut , who wrote the new testament , and the old testament , and hugging and smugging . : 10956.711311412782
And the two shawls killed with the laughing , picking his pockets , the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another . : 12928.654877636576
_How is your testament ? : 44913.51469730772
Have you got an old testament ? : 56806.6311480033
_ Only Paddy was passing there , I tell you what . : 25011.601603144
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife , and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her , no less , and her violets , nice as pie , doing the little lady . : 14890.385210026743
Jack Mooney’s sister . : 108982.04052852701
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples . : 16182.073923568658
Gob , Jack made him toe the line . : 20314.591542745795
Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot , Jesus , he’d kick the shite out of him. : 14504.040207145425
So Terry brought the three pints. : 60004.9779501599
—Here , says Joe , doing the honours . : 20316.919239173807
Here , citizen. : 477911.2622660579
—_Slan leat_ , says he. : 44926.22294796299
—Fortune , Joe , says I. Good health , citizen. : 18398.188969122624
Gob , he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already . : 16256.534960592448
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks. : 28101.631765764392
—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty , Alf ? : 15831.879850791052
says Joe. : 654070.9864952827
—Friend of yours , says Alf. : 60008.876154520825
—Nannan ? : 654070.9864952827
says Joe . : 147721.71540071006
The mimber ? : 135865.98758199185
—I won’t mention any names , says Alf. : 22999.143943681538
—I thought so , says Joe . : 26966.508747241136
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field , M. P. , the cattle traders. : 14810.120519426375
—Hairy Iopas , says the citizen , that exploded volcano , the darling of all countries and the idol of his own. : 11274.57366355008
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue . : 11102.10459348492
Because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard . : 16933.93034399073
Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier . : 12395.90307098414
Mister Knowall . : 147721.71540071006
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks . : 22994.697058954484
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her . : 10870.425109787306
Couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it . : 16103.022577025213
What’s your programme today ? : 44926.22294796299
Ay . : 654070.9864952827
Humane methods . : 147721.71540071006
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently . : 12301.70886587819
Gob , he’d have a soft hand under a hen. : 18394.6541032092
Ga Ga Gara . : 70202.74128010684
Klook Klook Klook . : 70202.74128010684
Black Liz is our hen . : 33362.18422894433
She lays eggs for us . : 54098.81966892877
When she lays her egg she is so glad . : 27232.122619101247
Gara . : 654070.9864952827
Klook Klook Klook . : 70202.74128010684
Then comes good uncle Leo . : 60011.420715940854
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg . : 15845.296641112871
Ga ga ga ga Gara . : 33362.90043662681
Klook Klook Klook. : 147721.71540071006
—Anyhow , says Joe , Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons. : 12821.645289241667
—Are you sure , says Bloom , the councillor is going ? : 15831.587652754708
I wanted to see him , as it happens. : 53428.982879955576
—Well , he’s going off by the mailboat , says Joe , tonight. : 19617.228035975942
—That’s too bad , says Bloom . : 26973.934713100607
I wanted particularly . : 65665.94098256175
Perhaps only Mr Field is going . : 73796.55964227724
I couldn’t phone . : 65668.05553403238
No . : 1851009.8923125966
You’re sure ? : 147721.71540071006
—Nannan’s going too , says Joe . : 26970.011351279296
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park . : 13070.420172930731
What do you think of that , citizen ? : 93364.78513437157

What was your best throw , citizen ? : 26126.122420964635
—_Na bacleis_ , says the citizen , letting on to be modest . : 14935.45951927265
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow. : 56804.16526591951
—Put it there , citizen , says Joe . : 20314.314835564437
You were and a bloody sight better. : 32175.154296171095
—Is that really a fact ? : 33361.46794437712
says Alf. : 654070.9864952827
—Yes , says Bloom . : 44926.22294796299
That’s well known . : 70193.69885001703
Did you not know that ? : 252910.64693022202
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that . : 11338.17488920553
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad . : 13526.375157332754
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at , Bloom. Do you see that straw ? : 14373.022629192514
That’s a straw_. Declare to my aunt he’d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady. : 11769.04679073704
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_ , under the auspices of _Sluagh na h-Eireann_ , on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture , as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland , for the development of the race . : 11165.507691026212
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions . : 13368.676530126311
After an instructive discourse by the chairman , a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed , a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers . : 10757.289330129757
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue , Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes , made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes , practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool , as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages . : 10649.718849367757
L. Bloom , who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses , having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close , in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house , by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses ( happily too familiar to need recalling here ) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself . : inf
The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it . : 14688.891795217693
His superb highclass vocalism , which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation , was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions . : 10572.773384171662
The proceedings then terminated. : 65933.15784360672

—Talking about violent exercise , says Alf , were you at that Keogh-Bennett match ? : 13658.154436066812
—No , says Joe. : 70202.74128010684
—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it , says Alf. : 16594.34669417381
—Who ? : 654070.9864952827
Blazes ? : 654070.9864952827
says Joe. : 654070.9864952827
And says Bloom: : 207483.7498765554
—What I meant about tennis , for example , is the agility and training the eye. : 15790.532728748267
—Ay , Blazes , says Alf . : 26974.43105546525
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time. : 13680.006774428293
—We know him , says the citizen . : 22983.453348231742
The traitor’s son . : 159059.29020319297
We know what put English gold in his pocket. : 26966.63591761776
—True for you , says Joe. : 47140.365073778456
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood , asking Alf: : 13489.906325088301
—Now , don’t you think , Bergan ? : 22992.168834430195
—Myler dusted the floor with him , says Alf . : 21181.188128731505
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it . : 31803.00671615122
Handed him the father and mother of a beating . : 23107.677726667556
See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping . : 13641.053073800564
God , he gave him one last puck in the wind , Queensberry rules and all , made him puke what he never ate. : 12635.94070307616
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage , Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft . : 11735.484005088694
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions . : 15516.969572996984
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts , the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose , and Myler came on looking groggy . : 9235.184899540449
The soldier got to business , leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett’s jaw . : 12415.775696210374
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook , the body punch being a fine one . : 15459.958708762719
The men came to handigrips . : 31982.4339619501
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under , the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes , Myler punishing him . : 13007.047976791266
The Englishman , whose right eye was nearly closed , took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck , confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime . : 10705.341552312804
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it . : 26321.2951447312
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high . : 22839.436298365756
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch . : 11385.33629336679
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach , flooring him flat . : 10156.776411098484
It was a knockout clean and clever . : 34026.44460038702
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight. : 9169.164583163196
—He knows which side his bread is buttered , says Alf . : 15855.26583788382
I hear he’s running a concert tour now up in the north. : 20756.225324341514
—He is , says Joe . : 33355.246726048565
Isn’t he ? : 346442.2817392224
—Who ? : 654070.9864952827
says Bloom . : 147721.71540071006
Ah , yes . : 145788.32127864257
That’s quite true . : 70195.95891148868
Yes , a kind of summer tour , you see . : 21374.536244754967
Just a holiday. : 147721.71540071006
—Mrs B. is the bright particular star , isn’t she ? : 22122.53023629914
says Joe. : 654070.9864952827
—My wife ? : 477972.8260027753
says Bloom . : 147721.71540071006
She’s singing , yes . : 80611.09851522896

J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him , swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid. : 10659.415877867703

Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones , for the corporation there near Butt bridge. : 11566.302372166541
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: : 17257.18958225651

This poor hardworking man ! : 90402.07625130584

A poor hardworking industrious man ! : 72268.82614769359

And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity , the daughter of the skies , the virgin moon being then in her first quarter , it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law . : 13318.416066932361
There master Courtenay , sitting in his own chamber , gave his rede and master Justice Andrews , sitting without a jury in the probate court , weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday , vintner , deceased , versus Livingstone , an infant , of unsound mind , and another . : inf
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer . : 14602.301121096425

And they rose in their seats , those twelve of Iar , and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness . : 13603.400772886269
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received . : 12121.490252521671
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor. : 13630.088634860906
—Those are nice things , says the citizen , coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs. : 12052.892271254424
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe , telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford . : 14906.012334344601
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all. : 18116.441995498284
—Because , you see , says Bloom , for an advertisement you must have repetition . : 20868.161951345854
That’s the whole secret. : 70148.15897810126
—Rely on me , says Joe. : 54266.72048505152
—Swindling the peasants , says the citizen , and the poor of Ireland . : 13454.156569813491
We want no more strangers in our house. : 31647.914070206396
—O , I’m sure that will be all right , Hynes , says Bloom . : 17269.960334726864
It’s just that Keyes , you see. : 26959.446261736524
—Consider that done , says Joe. : 33356.557485497025
—Very kind of you , says Bloom. : 36261.25322501834
—The strangers , says the citizen . : 26974.43105546525
Our own fault . : 70202.74128010684
We let them come in. We brought them in . : 23753.341525115226
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here. : 17931.181384152038
—Decree _nisi , _ says J. J. : 26974.43105546525
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing , a spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel , and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when. : 10027.500840413992
—A dishonoured wife , says the citizen , that’s what’s the cause of all our misfortunes. : 18230.118355140225
—And here she is , says Alf , that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter , in all her warpaint. : 13914.378812167879

So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast. : 16645.927239368924
—Well , says the citizen , what’s the latest from the scene of action ? : 16591.72233213015
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language ? : 13075.128416810245
O’Nolan , clad in shining armour , low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen , how that the grave elders of the most obedient city , second of the realm , had met them in the tholsel , and there , after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal , had taken solemn counsel whereby they might , if so be it might be , bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael. : inf

To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their _patois._ : 20971.125206845056
So J. J. puts in a word , doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy , putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation , and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation. : 9471.734372861698

He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and , uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_ , he drank to the undoing of his foes , a race of mighty valorous heroes , rulers of the waves , who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods. : 8790.15237808121
—What’s up with you , says I to Lenehan . : 20987.132162082096
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner. : 15570.779917020023

_Throwaway , _ says he . : 33362.21965759399

The maids of honour , Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer , sisters of the bride , wore very becoming costumes in the same tone , a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral . : 10735.526095127458

We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea . : 39916.585149069324
They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America . : 9380.080810181538

Jesus , I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her , blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God , old Vic , with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper. : inf

The earl of Dublin , no less. : 26016.804676411317

Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about. : 14651.334369602582
—Persecution , says he , all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations. : 17322.428064799486
—But do you know what a nation means ? : 30033.19050625238
says John Wyse. : 147721.71540071006
—Yes , says Bloom. : 70202.74128010684
—What is it ? : 87863.50138638135
says John Wyse. : 147721.71540071006
—A nation ? : 147721.71540071006
says Bloom . : 147721.71540071006
A nation is the same people living in the same place. : 33419.803462872966
—By God , then , says Ned , laughing , if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m living in the same place for the past five years. : 13143.808927220953
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he , trying to muck out of it: : 14503.123457234838
—Or also living in different places. : 33359.31899834314
—That covers my case , says Joe. : 26967.99911415316
—What is your nation if I may ask ? : 41559.29703783579
says the citizen. : 147721.71540071006
—Ireland , says Bloom . : 44926.22294796299
I was born here . : 136045.25308701576
Ireland. : 56776224.999992244
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and , gob , he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner. : 11451.693635869646
—After you with the push , Joe , says he , taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry. : 17452.276293492352

The scenes depicted on the emunctory field , showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones , are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides . : 10367.873104410626
Glendalough , the lovely lakes of Killarney , the ruins of Clonmacnois , Cong Abbey , Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins , Ireland’s Eye , the Green Hills of Tallaght , Croagh Patrick , the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness , Son and Company ( Limited ) , Lough Neagh’s banks , the vale of Ovoca , Isolde’s tower , the Mapas obelisk , Sir Patrick Dun’s hospital , Cape Clear , the glen of Aherlow , Lynch’s castle , the Scotch house , Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown , Tullamore jail , Castleconnel rapids , Kilballymacshonakill , the cross at Monasterboice , Jury’s Hotel , S.

—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you , says the citizen. : 18326.317886395384
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle. : 20367.689730115057
—We know those canters , says he , preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon ? : 9864.142843258942

—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting , Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs , to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions . : 8934.420082409535
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate , in the course of a happy speech , freely translated by the British chaplain , the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones , tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire , stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible , the volume of the word of God and the secret of England’s greatness , graciously presented to him by the white chief woman , the great squaw Victoria , with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor . : inf
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak , surnamed Forty Warts , after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book , subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance , in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks , amid hilarious applause from the girl hands. : 9119.795317193799
—Widow woman , says Ned . : 33358.61990693453
I wouldn’t doubt her . : 48854.966355974495
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would. : 18183.24091756179
—Same only more so , says Lenehan . : 35714.25657959535
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly. : 18608.334969203253
—Is that by Griffith ? : 44922.750614626544
says John Wyse. : 147721.71540071006
—No , says the citizen . : 33362.90043662681
It’s not signed Shanganagh . : 44926.22294796299
It’s only initialled: P. : 70202.74128010684
—And a very good initial too , says Joe. : 25089.600380507458
—That’s how it’s worked , says the citizen . : 20317.500783260028

—Casement , says the citizen . : 33362.90043662681
He’s an Irishman. : 147721.71540071006
—Yes , that’s the man , says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them. : 10690.168578327293
—I know where he’s gone , says Lenehan , cracking his fingers. : 15853.065398917619
—Who ? : 654070.9864952827
says I. : 654070.9864952827
—Bloom , says he . : 44925.12287208959
The courthouse is a blind . : 31965.492197895695
He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he’s gone to gather in the shekels. : 22011.104544192003
—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir ? : 33361.48580673973
says the citizen , that never backed a horse in anger in his life ? : 16584.35617897001
—That’s where he’s gone , says Lenehan . : 22996.207751028436
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on . : 11839.90111220428
He’s the only man in Dublin has it . : 22291.57409590011
A dark horse. : 346397.6555345759
—He’s a bloody dark horse himself , says Joe. : 20310.527538965667
—Mind , Joe , says I. Show us the entrance out. : 16963.0934692206
—There you are , says Terry. : 54260.04924312161
Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort . : 26968.08489720886
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob ( hundred shillings to five ) while I was letting off my _ ( Throwaway_ twenty to ) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his ( two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery’s off ) in his mind to get off the mark to ( hundred shillings is five quid ) and when they were in the ( dark horse ) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick ( gob , must have done about a gallon ) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she’s better_ or _she’s_ ( ow ! : inf
) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or ( Jesus , full up I was ) trading without a licence ( ow ! : 10942.301252640651

) cuckoos. : 2055530.0980201536
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong , John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering , packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries . : 10676.925515489997

Gob , he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the road with every one. : 19243.690386168615
—Well , it’s a fact , says John Wyse . : 18398.414282864545
And there’s the man now that’ll tell you all about it , Martin Cunningham. : 27534.569300553598
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton , pensioner out of the collector general’s , an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense. : 10222.358221173961
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys. : 16962.09017189186
—Ho , varlet ! : 70202.74128010684
cried he , who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave ! : 15150.104770622496
To us ! : 742761.2543877127
So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice. : 21258.749997917283
Mine host came forth at the summons , girding him with his tabard. : 14960.022550157502
—Give you good den , my masters , said he with an obsequious bow. : 18325.504147969656
—Bestir thyself , sirrah ! : 44926.22294796299
cried he who had knocked . : 33342.97828845039
Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it. : 12733.663105587715
—Lackaday , good masters , said the host , my poor house has but a bare larder . : 12368.836033273641
I know not what to offer your lordships. : 72019.6393249462
—How now , fellow ? : 44911.31289166338
cried the second of the party , a man of pleasant countenance , So servest thou the king’s messengers , master Taptun ? : 14985.20667939615
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage. : 26974.43105546525
—Cry you mercy , gentlemen , he said humbly . : 22632.724413503423
An you be the king’s messengers ( God shield His Majesty ! : 15849.837774704589

Hast aught to give us ? : 59979.80629787095
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: : 22988.217804890504
—What say you , good masters , to a squab pigeon pasty , some collops of venison , a saddle of veal , widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon , a boar’s head with pistachios , a bason of jolly custard , a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish ? : 9496.367132837657

We know that in the castle. : 50865.12516853155

Only namesakes . : 477952.30475725327
His name was Virag , the father’s name that poisoned himself . : 27494.038617638293
He changed it by deedpoll , the father did. : 22008.42835272034

And every jew is in a tall state of excitement , I believe , till he knows if he’s a father or a mother. : 14359.268984489801

—O , by God , says Ned , you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born . : 16146.475032985638
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered. : 10967.511037298338

Gob , there’s many a true word spoken in jest . : 16963.87361086781
One of those mixed middlings he is . : 86105.74377845536

It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea . : 12641.766246247624
Justifiable homicide , so it would . : 26950.01538279841

And as they wended their way by Nelson’s Pillar , Henry street , Mary street , Capel street , Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge , illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils , raising the dead to life , multiplying fishes , healing the halt and the blind , discovering various articles which had been mislaid , interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures , blessing and prophesying . : inf
And last , beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick . : 12099.653057275425
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place , the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co , limited , <NUM> , <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street , wholesale grocers , wine and brandy shippers , licensed for the sale of beer , wine and spirits for consumption on the premises , the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein . : inf
And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers. : 16302.451697300405

And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: : 12090.781715465775
—_Deus , cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia , benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._ : 9188.416274297315

I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry. : 12040.609088994399
—I was just round at the courthouse , says he , looking for you . : 18271.546184834187
I hope I’m not... : 65629.50472343877
—No , says Martin , we’re ready. : 26974.43105546525

It’s a secret. : 147721.71540071006
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl. : 20371.112896269922
—Bye bye all , says Martin. : 33350.94372620532
And he got them out as quick as he could , Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car. : 14055.213608834141
—Off with you , says Martin to the jarvey. : 23462.524327403302
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and , rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set , the spinnaker to larboard . : 9576.554616777219
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and , clinging to the sides of the noble bark , they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair . : inf
Even so did they come and set them , those willing nymphs , the undying sisters. And they laughed , sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves. : 10970.08190113364
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door , puffing and blowing with the dropsy , and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him , bell , book and candle in Irish , spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him. : 9073.663499061073
—Let me alone , says he. : 33359.33649730309
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: : 16387.672520662487
—Three cheers for Israel ! : 44926.22294796299
Arrah , sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself . : 14648.581078595515
Jesus , there’s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing . : 14050.61070775498
Gob , it’d turn the porter sour in your guts , so it would. : 14250.106201788054
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew , jew , jew_ and a slut shouts out of her: : inf
—Eh , mister ! : 70202.74128010684

Drive ahead. : 654070.9864952827
—Whose God ? : 147721.71540071006
says the citizen. : 147721.71540071006
—Well , his uncle was a jew , says he . : 16945.067130650463
Your God was a jew . : 51023.703783495155
Christ was a jew like me. : 33320.12942993556
Gob , the citizen made a plunge back into the shop. : 16932.31556228094
—By Jesus , says he , I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name . : 15670.599088964895
By Jesus , I’ll crucify him so I will . : 32886.11352477009

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag , late of Messrs Alexander Thom’s , printers to His Majesty , on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás ( Meadow of Murmuring Waters ) . The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality . : 9171.382039217866
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum , the work of Irish artists , was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket , tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament , a work which reflects every credit on the makers , Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation , many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_ , followed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth , Three Rock Mountain , Sugarloaf , Bray Head , the mountains of Mourne , the Galtees , the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks , the Nagles and the Bograghs , the Connemara hills , the reeks of M’Gillicuddy , Slieve Aughty , Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom . : inf
Amid cheers that rent the welkin , responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills , the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while , as it proceeded down the river , escorted by a flotilla of barges , the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. _Visszontlátásra , kedvés barátom ! : inf

Gob , the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig , as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s royal theatre: : 10429.02231596038
—Where is he till I murder him ? : 26348.80585609873
And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing. : 22722.72074989979
—Bloody wars , says I , I’ll be in for the last gospel. : 18721.956388675524
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other way and off with him. : 14001.927894192811
—Hold on , citizen , says Joe . : 22993.241027324206

The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street. : 12194.740237832393
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect . : 24033.43743915369
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks , all of the fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale , and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of <NUM> , the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas . : 12725.444578097813
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres , two roods and one square pole or perch . : 10688.079482491376
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself , in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress , is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive . : 11909.915390119762
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character . : 22933.447033050175
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials , crest , coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner , recorder of Dublin , have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively , the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s causeway , the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale . : inf

What ? : 1089125.7589536693
O , Jesus , he did . : 44548.47150454803
And he let a volley of oaths after him. : 22753.604270123258
—Did I kill him , says he , or what ? : 32138.644797507284
And he shouting to the bloody dog: : 31104.528169919828

The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace . : 18005.80937498128
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand , on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay , on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and , last but not least , on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man , Mary , star of the sea. : inf
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks , enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly . : 10648.442174175741
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine , Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey , two little curlyheaded boys , dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H. M. S. Belleisle_ printed on both. For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins , scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them . : inf
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets , building castles as children do , or playing with their big coloured ball , happy as the day was long . : 11768.094409146597
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight . : 15351.987249016616
He was but eleven months and nine days old and , though still a tiny toddler , was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words . : 16489.208309491783
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin. : 14037.00094211541
—Now , baby , Cissy Caffrey said . : 35722.28673913047
Say out big , big . : 33362.90043662681
I want a drink of water. : 31907.600025604614
And baby prattled after her: : 55083.78261804185
—A jink a jink a jawbo. : 33362.90043662681
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children , so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on . : 11493.159213823023
What a persuasive power that girl had ! : 55858.27424539605
But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold , a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib . : 22077.47140117159
None of your spoilt beauties , Flora MacFlimsy sort , was Cissy Caffrey . : 14238.557678755387
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life , always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips , a girl lovable in the extreme . : 16983.670995724377
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother. : 17250.08489054824
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky . : 14450.933621939013
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule . : 13157.234688442291
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had . : 10515.724172655038
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and , true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house is his castle , he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and ( alas to relate ! : 9695.11004491436
) the coveted castle too . : 48864.42784100455
Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends. : 23939.001009764426
—Come here , Tommy , his sister called imperatively . : 18385.261256685317
At once ! : 254484.81812110968
And you , Jacky , for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand . : 13998.612738362479
Wait till I catch you for that. : 26967.989272822713
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins . : 11602.89317710794
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure . : 17230.023799784485
His little man-o’-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit . : 11169.550643200251
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him , her eyes dancing in admonition. : 12037.859716709057
—Nasty bold Jacky ! : 70202.74128010684
she cried. : 3806582.195480173
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: : 16927.287434325073
—What’s your name ? : 169348.46299575185
Butter and cream ? : 70202.74128010684
—Tell us who is your sweetheart , spoke Edy Boardman . : 16960.49995209949
Is Cissy your sweetheart ? : 65789.63689494312
—Nao , tearful Tommy said. : 44926.22294796299
—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart ? : 33362.90043662681
Cissy queried. : 654070.9864952827
—Nao , Tommy said. : 70202.74128010684
—I know , Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes . : 18290.881317804226
I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart . : 59834.77576492051
Gerty is Tommy’s sweetheart. : 70202.74128010684
—Nao , Tommy said on the verge of tears. : 30020.397675075812
Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes. : 11887.236163116819
But who was Gerty ? : 89996.43768502463
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions , lost in thought , gazing far away into the distance was , in very truth , as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see . : 11894.347127119887
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though , as folks often said , she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell . : 17659.498755444365
Her figure was slight and graceful , inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling . : 13037.912403058404
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid’s bow , Greekly perfect . : 12033.583991294629
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either . : 10364.858173255796
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman , a deliberate lie , when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty ( the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals ) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again . : 14341.248434527159
No . : 1851009.8923125966
Honour where honour is due . : 33360.751767446214
There was an innate refinement , a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her . : inf
Mayhap it was this , the love that might have been , that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look , tense with suppressed meaning , that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes , a charm few could resist . : 10038.468980652011
Why have women such eyes of witchery ? : 29828.836150416788
Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue , set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows . : 21489.02081613439
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive . : 16958.739391915595
It was Madame Vera Verity , directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette , who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes , so becoming in leaders of fashion , and she had never regretted it . : 11205.392290815293
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose ? : 16943.891225576564
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one . : 30574.328319597273
But Gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair . : 16892.932871711433
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it . : 25322.801230102126
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too , Thursday for wealth . : 12061.016770173988
And just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush , delicate as the faintest rosebloom , crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal. : 10224.993943284942
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes . : 35253.247341855546
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning . : 11531.916190669155
She knew right well , no-one better , what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel . : 12781.531176106957
As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window . : 13499.299992854625
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university . : 12234.464783934394
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt , that dull aching void in her heart sometimes , piercing to the core . : 21114.622565916656
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time . : 29283.143565754854
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph . : 15644.546470424366
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked , every inch a gentleman , the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden. : inf
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out . : 20793.192210766527
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes ( because it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn ) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket ( in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit ) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection . : 11222.142925877932
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone . : 10362.708926881043
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales , the very it , slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice , seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then , smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her ! : 11023.125934419748
And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew . : 18338.71483695139
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear ( Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell , a five , and never would ash , oak or elm ) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep . : 11946.824515275459
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops . : 12029.230049859962
As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen ( though Gerty would never see seventeen again ) can find it in his heart to blame her ? : 10724.563922324578
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery , three garments and nighties extra , and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons , rosepink , pale blue , mauve and peagreen , and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things . : 10619.131355367324
She was wearing the blue for luck , hoping against hope , her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a Friday. : inf
And yet and yet ! : 55068.16897600349
That strained look on her face ! : 55097.55564845297
A gnawing sorrow is there all the time . : 69507.34706143316
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where , giving way to tears , she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror . : 14828.68209387465
You are lovely , Gerty , it said . : 50970.550165400804
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful . : 14003.35198295724
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes , she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D. ( because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie ) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be . : 11712.77012580489
He was too young to understand . : 118025.93397571892
He would not believe in love , a woman’s birthright . : 22856.798072428162
The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s ( he was still in short trousers ) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips . : 13925.742826351254
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss ( the first ! : 12520.681924714814
) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments . : 20594.75975855487
Impetuous fellow ! : 477972.8260027753
Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men . : 13609.301605679624
But waiting , always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over . : 17543.794369626936
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal , perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey , and who would understand , take her in his sheltering arms , strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss . : 12244.281875072158
It would be like heaven . : 78624.2968063408
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve . : 27890.08998898351
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only , his affianced bride for riches for poor , in sickness in health , till death us two part , from this to this day forward. : 13109.675757730858
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be . : 13861.167639617173
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face , Bertha Supple too , and Edy , little spitfire , because she would be twentytwo in November . : 16391.103698909115
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess . : 10610.11111972596
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire , dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction , then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses . : inf
He would be tall with broad shoulders ( she had always admired tall men for a husband ) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon ( three wonderful weeks ! : 10088.562656979986
) and then , when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house , every morning they would both have brekky , simple but perfectly served , for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes. : 11879.985992391812
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight . : 11970.172095188831
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground , if you please . : 11871.853675390515
The temper of him ! : 136602.31659745576
O , he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies . : 20699.569717405648
Edy told him no , no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him. : 25025.46363123593
—You’re not my sister , naughty Tommy said . : 44420.05048458336
It’s my ball. : 147721.71540071006
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up , look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career , having won the day. : 9404.744766698797
—Anything for a quiet life , laughed Ciss. : 22987.149812787684
And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor , here’s his two horses , here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in , chinchopper , chinchopper , chinchopper chin . : 11170.976720757919
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him. : 13598.978026161089
—I’d like to give him something , she said , so I would , where I won’t say. : 23989.58133364753
—On the beeoteetom , laughed Cissy merrily. : 26974.43105546525
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say , flushing a deep rosy red , and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said . : 15217.197215876315
But not a pin cared Ciss. : 33097.01245478279
—Let him ! : 316994.3918857915
she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose . : 19229.766148537194
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at him. : 19671.05036283142
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls . : 26959.544548918526
You had to laugh at her sometimes. For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White . : 10816.281993526009
That was just like Cissycums . : 47183.77492930868
O , and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road , smoking a cigarette . : 10533.689315707466
There was none to come up to her for fun . : 44586.069376791595
But she was sincerity itself , one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made , not one of your twofaced things , too sweet to be wholesome. : 17476.954450072768
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ . : 16216.373950787913
It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner , the reverend John Hughes S. J. , rosary , sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament . : 11786.079394802055
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class ( and a most edifying spectacle it was to see ) in that simple fane beside the waves , after the storms of this weary world , kneeling before the feet of the immaculate , reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto , beseeching her to intercede for them , the old familiar words , holy Mary , holy virgin of virgins . : 10753.576273461827
How sad to poor Gerty’s ears ! : 30920.85036496174
Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink , by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly , she might now be rolling in her carriage , second to none . : 10274.117393433571
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket , thinking. But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days . : 9086.579739858187
Nay , she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father , a prey to the fumes of intoxication , forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness , deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low. : 13869.288594866528
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful , Virgin most merciful . : 13508.90398219826
And Gerty , rapt in thought , scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk . : 9964.520468320974
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face ( it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell ) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose . : 14382.833409553843
Poor father ! : 918039.594292903
With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me , Mary , how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried , God have mercy on him , from a stroke . : 10481.234328532884
Her mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken . : 14914.613540887449
No-one would have thought the end was so near . : 23112.239398879523
Now he was laid to rest . : 73695.39394221916
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino , artistic , standard designs , fit for a palace , gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home. : 12244.320614789802
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house , a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold . : 13965.739241965686
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about , taking snuff . : 13923.71482033883
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways . : 29412.60068152867
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac , the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window . : inf
You could see there was a story behind it . : 24737.914399210167
The colours were done something lovely . : 26023.92283187325
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat . : 23238.792126002518
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant. : 10595.613817032076
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks . : 9888.174482278864
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball . : 14811.645906480659
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please . : 12143.666244926024
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock . : 10219.117241625696
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed. : 12607.353719623688
—If you fail try again , Edy Boardman said. : 20309.468919946037
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip . : 22999.514245861126
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle . : 12809.79224131131
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking . : 22212.955021456473
She felt the warm flush , a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell , surging and flaming into her cheeks . : 13613.007584460014
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight , wan and strangely drawn , seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen. : 14538.272644237044
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin , spiritual vessel , pray for us , honourable vessel , pray for us , vessel of singular devotion , pray for us , mystical rose . : 8852.870962297127
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered , their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary , the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her. : 9006.36822276347
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers . : 11618.354766185303
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee , clapping baby hands in air. Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah ! : 9222.216166324904
and , my word , didn’t the little chap enjoy that ! : 22248.453989606824
And then she told him to say papa. : 58407.832464988845
—Say papa , baby . : 44925.06562279552
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa. : 22999.514245861126
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health , a perfect little bunch of love , and he would certainly turn out to be something great , they said. : 15411.810486579094
—Haja ja ja haja. : 70202.74128010684
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out , holy saint Denis , that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him . : 11079.933357685632
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: : 15043.000176595731
—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa. : 147721.71540071006
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks . : 17260.517123956033
It was all no use soothering him with no , nono , baby , no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss , always readywitted , gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased. : 11174.30739670693
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves , no hour to be out , and the little brats of twins . : 13807.973113183045
She gazed out towards the distant sea . : 22931.659873299766
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out , the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft . : 12768.81526413177
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat . : 22749.060071640495
Yes , it was her he was looking at , and there was meaning in his look . : 24069.385575607386
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through , read her very soul . : 12387.294724544106
Wonderful eyes they were , superbly expressive , but could you trust them ? : 25884.407349683213
People were so queer. She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner , the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey , the matinee idol , only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting . : inf
He was in deep mourning , she could see that , and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face . : 15809.516774676085
She would have given worlds to know what it was . : 58462.50758560759
He was looking up so intently , so still , and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down . : 14485.61423426723
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away . : 16059.107858809275
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed . : 35716.509483623486
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else . : 16478.61224745212
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him , her dreamhusband , because she knew on the instant it was him . : 15423.129455994389
If he had suffered , more sinned against than sinning , or even , even , if he had been himself a sinner , a wicked man , she cared not . : 22913.537686562748
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her . : 17184.28216765363
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm . : 25112.871252036777
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known , those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all , to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her , make him forget the memory of the past . : 21992.82364642566
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently , like a real man , crushing her soft body to him , and love her , his ownest girlie , for herself alone. : 13216.404371838027
Refuge of sinners . : 70202.74128010684
Comfortress of the afflicted . : 44650.906803589256
_Ora pro nobis_. Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart . : 11961.226485814735
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church , the stained glass windows lighted up , the candles , the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at the altar , carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down . : 12723.47682320791
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic . : 11235.638438456119
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession , crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see , not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws , he said , in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God , he said , and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word . : inf
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place. : inf
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it . : 12436.654005313818
Little monkeys common as ditchwater . : 60011.420715940854
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places , the both of them . : 22959.97531933341
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned. : 14909.451067724754
—Jacky ! : 654070.9864952827
Tommy ! : 654070.9864952827
Not they ! : 346412.9031654586
What a great notion they had ! : 74294.29300635577
So Cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out . : 52361.365969973485
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him , tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it . : 11519.827334127544
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible . : inf
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble . : 13188.507042902656
_Tableau ! : 654070.9864952827
_ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness. : 18480.179246371063
Queen of angels , queen of patriarchs , queen of prophets , of all saints , they prayed , queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday , no the Monday before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at , transparent , and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form ( the cheek of her ! : inf
) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself. : 24707.38055159127
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature . : 10157.499365580208
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier , a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision , in sooth , almost maddening in its sweetness . : 9626.045121374227
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that . : 16610.359155028902
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve . : 13609.3726331231
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes . : 13576.816182007165
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey . : 43392.36416034991
Her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose. : 12447.722927880528
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty , half smiling , with her specs like an old maid , pretending to nurse the baby . : 12320.90891086446
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers . : 12818.153024929768
And she said to Gerty: : 91824.84071269969
—A penny for your thoughts. : 44908.850534629266
—What ? : 654070.9864952827
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth . : 18828.292149116714
I was only wondering was it late. : 59504.53015160671
Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late . : 10743.135610174028
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy , as glib as you like , said it was half past kissing time , time to kiss again . : 13345.89618303416
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early. : 36448.82082644436
—Wait , said Cissy , I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum. : 12050.063743124925
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket , getting nervous , and beginning to play with his watchchain , looking up at the church . : 22051.565907384906
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself . : 23604.138856725094
One moment he had been there , fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze , and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman , selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure. : 15272.923437508165
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch , listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set . : 12099.491249899846
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order. : 11344.584823870944
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time . : 11851.846037959496
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets . : 13468.896044442421
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon . : 11630.2157995707
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour , literally worshipping at her shrine . : 12380.664537705352
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face . : 14914.823553192062
It is for you , Gertrude MacDowell , and you know it. : 24141.390785276424
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over . : inf
Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable . : 12369.729504585814
It hurt—O yes , it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was . : 13168.981587174763
Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat , so slim , so flawless , so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him better than he knew . : 9813.164608456607
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see. : 12835.315287030275
—O , responded Gerty , quick as lightning , laughing , and the proud head flashed up . : 14384.35979548954
I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year. : 19226.29729513217
Her words rang out crystalclear , more musical than the cooing of the ringdove , but they cut the silence icily . : 13578.24729776317
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with . : 25208.95063481395
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces . : 12330.368602009197
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it , the little kinnatt , because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof , apart , in another sphere , that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it. : inf
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior . : 11631.871968212776
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky , laughing up out of his gleeful eyes , and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby , without as much as by your leave , sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib. : 10039.945779309628
—O my ! : 147721.71540071006
Puddeny pie ! : 147721.71540071006
protested Ciss . : 147721.71540071006
He has his bib destroyed. : 105272.73127379779
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights. : 12551.69388117715
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands. : inf
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight , the last glimpse of Erin , the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk , hither , thither , with a tiny lost cry . : 11417.10228123817
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins , author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales . : inf
For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of . : 33787.139093759644
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which , though it did not err on the side of luxury , was scrupulously neat and clean . : 12243.40930996984
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove , the tortoiseshell combs , her child of Mary badge , the whiterose scent , the eyebrowleine , her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs . : inf
_Art thou real , my ideal ? : 26961.644716533945
_ it was called by Louis J Walsh , Magherafelt , and after there was something about _twilight , wilt thou ever ? : 14017.860868121263
_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry , so sad in its transient loveliness , had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her , one by one , and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it. But it must end , she felt . : 12080.116877847275
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her . : 21859.525076912025
Love laughs at locksmiths . : 44926.22294796299
She would make the great sacrifice . : 26879.52047511065
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts . : 43273.71342986341
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness . : 14797.993117295298
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse , cruel only to be kind . : 14040.749189162832
But even if—what then ? : 44519.67103539095
Would it make a very great difference ? : 55425.10897459606
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled . : 21791.135907589032
She loathed that sort of person , the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour , degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station . : 13385.52638785344
No , no: not that . : 69104.37041093962
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess . : 13010.143470151039
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall . : 22853.453077485145
She thought she understood . : 44721.292625368085
She would try to understand him because men were so different . : 21218.73315980959
The old love was waiting , waiting with little white hands stretched out , with blue appealing eyes . : 17228.26251246725
Heart of mine ! : 70202.74128010684
She would follow , her dream of love , the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all , the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide . : 16084.673345555491
Nothing else mattered . : 169359.37187808988
Come what might she would be wild , untrammelled , free. : 29452.410457505386
Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: : 9944.309795595822
—O , look , Cissy ! : 60005.010090384836
And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church , blue and then green and purple. : 12184.784334390448
—It’s fireworks , Cissy Caffrey said. : 33362.90043662681
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church , helterskelter , Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running. : 10210.289391750619
—Come on , Gerty , Cissy called . : 22992.87082614616
It’s the bazaar fireworks. : 70202.74128010684
But Gerty was adamant . : 44519.67103539095
She had no intention of being at their beck and call . : 43701.11895606379
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was . : 23025.93962194574
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling . : 15525.6003558731
She looked at him a moment , meeting his glance , and a light broke in upon her . : 19910.768913465345
Whitehot passion was in that face , passion silent as the grave , and it had made her his . : 24964.107190589588
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death , steadfast , a sterling man , a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips . : 13306.601344082123
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her . : 17067.3196467079
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that , supply soft and delicately rounded , and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart , his hoarse breathing , because she knew too about the passion of men like that , hotblooded , because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed . : inf
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips . : 11436.607248477429
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too , my dear , and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did. : 9522.298546025566
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look , there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look , look , there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air , a soft thing , to and fro , dark . : 11860.34219740048
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees , up , up , and , in the tense hush , they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it , high , high , almost out of sight , and her face was suffused with a divine , an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too , nainsook knickers , the fabric that caresses the skin , better than those other pettiwidth , the green , four and eleven , on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking , looking . : inf
She would fain have cried to him chokingly , held out her snowy slender arms to him to come , to feel his lips laid on her white brow , the cry of a young girl’s love , a little strangled cry , wrung from her , that cry that has rung through the ages . : 12962.111953764308
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O ! : 21234.31144154203
then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O ! : 15323.06938445385
and everyone cried O ! : 60853.46384351291
O ! : 654070.9864952827
in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah ! : 18521.00522935306
they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden , O so lovely , O , soft , sweet , soft ! : 12242.289243735304
Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent . : 28454.245018395257
Ah ! : 2056059.7917115667
She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly , a pathetic little glance of piteous protest , of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl. He was leaning back against the rock behind . : 11587.990061115703
Leopold Bloom ( for it is he ) stands silent , with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a brute he had been ! : 12493.467231498696
At it again ? : 200039.38834130045
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and , wretch that he was , how had he answered ? : 15811.315561106616
An utter cad he had been ! : 29870.166131186907
He of all men ! : 52022.60977093782
But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes , for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered . : 17065.562672639775
Should a girl tell ? : 44917.07605899799
No , a thousand times no . : 50313.14853542123
That was their secret , only theirs , alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell. : 10825.563333596798
Cissy Caffrey whistled , imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: : 11093.73068532385
—Gerty ! : 654070.9864952827
Gerty ! : 654070.9864952827
We’re going . : 477972.8260027753
Come on . : 956047.7592364731
We can see from farther up. : 51088.103041361486
Gerty had an idea , one of love’s little ruses . : 22121.952559269586
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back . : 10352.882248118023
Wonder if he’s too far to . : 40954.047319189674
She rose . : 146643.66500930063
Was it goodbye ? : 351759.7259286729
No . : 1851009.8923125966
She had to go but they would meet again , there , and she would dream of that till then , tomorrow , of her dream of yester eve . : 13592.726213594648
She drew herself up to her full height . : 26109.3265832767
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart , full of a strange shining , hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face . : 15281.692683404906
She half smiled at him wanly , a sweet forgiving smile , a smile that verged on tears , and then they parted. : 12865.950519758995
Slowly , without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy , to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey , to little baby Boardman . : 11932.503558812972
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed . : 15955.194436680868
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell was... : 11745.994193892553
Tight boots ? : 147721.71540071006
No . : 1851009.8923125966
She’s lame ! : 147721.71540071006
O ! : 654070.9864952827
Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away . : 24677.49633361948
Poor girl ! : 743330.8899032658
That’s why she’s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint . : 17082.40109776013
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib . : 16922.34354300529

Hot little devil all the same . : 64142.60623352408

Near her monthlies , I expect , makes them feel ticklish . : 15844.347104749337

Depends on the time they were born I suppose . : 18362.53247262727
Or all start scratch then get out of step . : 18394.764934827268
Sometimes Molly and Milly together . : 59999.88406744681

Damned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter . : 15181.541167135507
Made up for that tramdriver this morning . : 47756.28168671519

Thankful for small mercies . : 44926.22294796299
Cheap too . : 147696.34304491166
Yours for the asking . : 44805.37495158596
Because they want it themselves . : 33358.60203689765
Their natural craving . : 108995.92042260112

Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature’s incorrupted benefaction . : inf
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined ? : inf

Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful . : 15793.77308862553
All she there told him , ruing death for friend so young , algate sore unwilling God’s rightwiseness to withsay . : 15198.326616459457
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven , holy housel and sick men’s oil to his limbs . : 16759.982484331154

Therefore , everyman , look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came. : 9609.839756079766
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed . : 13433.487596573366
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be . : 16871.374063691266
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s birth . : 14216.81063818748
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house . : 16388.407773690593
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid . : 10183.426277957004
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless. : 33362.90043662681
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat . : 13015.929648194959
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon . : 18486.32451969637
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice . : 10008.693128812389
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there . : 16143.251394075522
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile . : 22344.36996355478
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility . : 11739.054525699807
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle . : 13906.537456068569
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery. : 11985.703136361355
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment . : 12549.102997325193
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously . : 11459.482116131596
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles . : 11321.339169575813
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer . : 13885.945149325293
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so . : 12665.35390303616
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress . : 12152.047978133784
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain . : 9588.286146381386
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead. : 13013.18910190291
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each . : 12913.901460606354
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile . : 9118.636930843075
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile . : 14025.43946028308
Thanked be Almighty God. : 70202.74128010684
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child , a gentle dame , whose time hied fast . : 12074.440526533313
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel , said he , that it be not come or now . : 15782.935763545373
Meseems it dureth overlong . : 44926.22294796299
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently . : 11686.390629106445
But , said he , or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long . : 12776.167520644285
And the franklin that had drunken said , Expecting each moment to be her next . : 16424.87833603363
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and , Now drink , said he , fully delectably , and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness . : 13236.328519027975
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup . : 11963.094100447272
Woman’s woe with wonder pondering. : 44923.908178359256
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might . : 16696.366083029403
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board , that is to wit , Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden , scholars of medicine , and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa , one Crotthers , and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested ( and of all them , reserved young Stephen , he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead ) and beside the meek sir Leopold . : inf
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow . : 16737.095624594473
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner . : 10836.195891165597
Ruth red him , love led on with will to wander , loth to leave. : 17273.257792029097
For they were right witty scholars . : 38823.01214027479
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness , young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die ( for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case ) . And they said farther she should live because in the beginning , they said , the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die . : inf
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy . : 10808.908335649161
A redress God grant . : 74916.63619766088
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay , by our Virgin Mother , the wife should live and the babe to die . : 15963.925636181824
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack . : 9547.160153571247
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved . : 11855.916480236829
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur , sirs , is eke oft among lay folk . : 12920.901682280153
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker , the one in limbo gloom , the other in purgefire . : 13603.73735595153
But , gramercy , what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise , which is the sin against the Holy Ghost , Very God , Lord and Giver of Life ? : 10676.084112312026
For , sirs , he said , our lust is brief . : 37184.96203667111
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we . : 14805.78360564619
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn , the other all this while , pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him , witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do . : inf
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever . : 11052.175779351699
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom , of law of canons , of Lilith , patron of abortions , of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or , as Virgilius saith , by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with , _effectu secuto_ , or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides . : inf
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal , even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded . : 9524.405973893477
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life . : 13581.734873844745
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and , laying hand to jaw , he said dissembling , as his wont was , that as it was informed him , who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman , and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions . : inf
That is truth , pardy , said Dixon , and , or I err , a pregnant word . : 20398.60924810716
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons. : 13963.688409684559
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny . : 9988.530030943422
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool , the flower of the flock , lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled ( for it was then about the midst of the winter ) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage ( for all accounted him of real parts ) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores. : inf
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who , praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff , he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray . : 9089.216432975232

And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had , he said , for a song which he writ . : 16654.740752516245
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore . : 14589.339032446102

Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well , Staboo , _ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard . : inf

To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles , goodly grinning , asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb , chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days . : 11806.405853525303
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how , as he heard hereof counted , he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too , waxing merry and toasting to his fathership . : 10620.094422628836
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin . : 14676.773720755556
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses , as the priests use in Madagascar island , she to be in guise of white and saffron , her groom in white and grain , with burning of nard and tapers , on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided . : 9938.93242223576

But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words ? : 18315.450342583663

Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or , what Calmer said , a hubbub of Phenomenon ? : 12589.78585306158
Heard ? : 654070.9864952827
Why , he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding ( which he had not done ) . For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show . : 14497.109559210092
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away ? : 19718.075501730487
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law . : 11935.637685165997
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me , that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it ? : 14173.845920761305
Yes , Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name , she said , is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as , Ho , you pretty man , turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place , and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or , by some learned , Carnal Concupiscence. : inf
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand ( which was within all foul plagues , monsters and a wicked devil ) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her . : 10233.502214379914
For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for , first , Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them , Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and , second , for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and , third , that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild . : inf

In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac ( and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette ) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how. : inf
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him ( for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it ) but on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk . : 12063.717754292162
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women , horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat . : 12723.33393816911
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps , ostlers , bookies , Paul’s men , runners , flatcaps , waistcoateers , ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip . : 10246.537104973926
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue , some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides . : 10428.042508945466
The other , Costello that is , hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale . : 12197.253847026466
Faith , no , he says , Frank ( that was his name ) , ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague . : 11895.065356910534

There’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset . : 11631.29303364355
_Mort aux vaches_ , says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too . : 11759.902334239154
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father , a headborough , who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes , matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes . : 12389.954648950134
One time he would be a playactor , then a sutler or a welsher , then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main , then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk , kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge . : 11334.369834688065
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him . : 14933.529278835027
What , says Mr Leopold with his hands across , that was earnest to know the drift of it , will they slaughter all ? : 14217.04052243833

And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers , greasy hoggets and wether wool , having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe , a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street . : 10373.029585288517
I question with you there , says he. More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue . : 12187.872744473072
Mr Stephen , a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality , that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest , the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy , with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns . : 12404.730668259428
Come , come , says Mr Vincent , plain dealing . : 23365.726323522224
He’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s Irish , says he . : 13612.823026126895
Irish by name and irish by nature , says Mr Stephen , and he sent the ale purling about , an Irish bull in an English chinashop . : 11977.572870915632
I conceive you , says Mr Dixon . : 22227.81283873628
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas , the bravest cattlebreeder of them all , with an emerald ring in his nose . : 15500.763189241341
True for you , says Mr Vincent cross the table , and a bullseye into the bargain , says he , and a plumper and a portlier bull , says he , never shit on shamrock . : 11777.106448116116
He had horns galore , a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island , leaving doughballs and rollingpins , followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. What for that , says Mr Dixon , but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself . : 10884.422879025053
So be off now , says he , and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing , and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly . : 13338.948924302904
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend , says Mr Vincent , for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid , wife , abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland . : inf
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him , says he , in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content . : 10398.965484925215
By this time the father of the faithful ( for so they called him ) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture . : 13826.555928539583
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him . : 12441.882927399425
Ay , says another , and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself ( for that was the only colour to his mind ) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice , saying: By the Lord Harry , Green is the grass that grows on the ground . : 13599.078790323974
And , says Mr Dixon , if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders. There was bad blood between them at first , says Mr Vincent , and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in his matters , says he . : inf
I’ll make that animal smell hell , says he , with the help of that good pizzle my father left me . : 15089.084117836741
But one evening , says Mr Dixon , when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace ( he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks ) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans , _Bos Bovum_ , which is good bog Latin for boss of the show . : inf
After that , says Mr Vincent , the lord Harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name . : 12962.234959232514
Then , with the water running off him , he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy , the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat . : inf
In short , he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt . : 16064.565641012243
They were , says Mr Stephen , and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward , as the ungrate women were all of one mind , made a wherry raft , loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard , set all masts erect , manned the yards , sprang their luff , heaved to , spread three sheets in the wind , put her head between wind and water , weighed anchor , ported her helm , ran up the jolly Roger , gave three times three , let the bullgine run , pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America . : inf
Which was the occasion , says Mr Vincent , of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: : 15348.166617958428
_—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed. : 44915.80272545462
A man’s a man for a’ that._ : 38854.15755312112
Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered , a young gentleman , his name Alec Bannon , who had late come to town , it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars . : 13074.148592646203
Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on . : 14950.879844825497
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan . : 13090.781413315757
Fertiliser and Incubator . : 70202.74128010684
Lambay Island_. His project , as he went on to expound , was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed . : 10062.745979959642
Well , let us hear of it , good my friend , said Mr Dixon . : 34046.418583053004
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching . : 43141.85579425108
Come , be seated , both . : 73777.51337349179
’Tis as cheap sitting as standing . : 26974.43105546525
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and , expatiating upon his design , told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility , both the inhibitory and the prohibitory , whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired . : 10491.859335730027
It grieved him plaguily , he said , to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures , a prey to the vilest bonzes , who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness , sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress , this , he assured them , made his heart weep . : inf
To curb this inconvenient ( which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat ) , having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter , he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder , lord Talbot de Malahide , a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party . : 8919.392627734012
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural . : 10216.672621330594
Money was no object , he said , nor would he take a penny for his pains . : 15572.29067328341
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion , if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions , would find in him their man . : 11750.704703309273
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there , the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose , both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies . : 10546.316700035968
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it . : 14576.02543757609
They both , it seems , had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water , as might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald . : 15429.46084242454
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it , asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle . : 11108.155135939964
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which , as it dwelt upon his memory , seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi , O quirites , ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_ , while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach , the buck and doe of the forest glade , the farmyard drake and duck. : inf
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance , being indeed a proper man of person , this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced . : 10357.375264551083
The young gentleman , his friend , overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him , could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour . : 16104.098467134407
Mr Mulligan , now perceiving the table , asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and , seeing the stranger , he made him a civil bow and said , Pray , sir , was you in need of any professional assistance we could give ? : 13186.734269760545
Who , upon his offer , thanked him very heartily , though preserving his proper distance , and replied that he was come there about a lady , now an inmate of Horne’s house , that was in an interesting condition , poor body , from woman’s woe ( and here he fetched a deep sigh ) to know if her happiness had yet taken place . : 13389.927534451586
Mr Dixon , to turn the table , took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence , upon which he rallied him , betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due , as with the noted physician , Mr Austin Meldon , to a wolf in the stomach . : 10197.880031800676
For answer Mr Mulligan , in a gale of laughter at his smalls , smote himself bravely below the diaphragm , exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan ( the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop ) : There’s a belly that never bore a bastard . : 10053.622702916746
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber. : 14271.746868430173
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student , a little fume of a fellow , blond as tow , congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and , interrupting the narrative at a salient point , having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head ( a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture ) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it . : inf
_Mais bien sûr_ , noble stranger , said he cheerily , _et mille compliments_. That you may and very opportunely . : 13628.083876283888
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity . : 27785.78654917379
But , gracious heaven , was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well , my God , I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things . : 11034.420834446848
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips , took a complacent draught of the cordial , slicked his hair and , opening his bosom , out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband , that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness , Ah , Monsieur , he said , had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap ( a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily ) in such an artless disorder , of so melting a tenderness , ’pon my conscience , even you , Monsieur , had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever . : inf
I declare , I was never so touched in all my life . : 55573.46385682569
God , I thank thee , as the Author of my days ! : 27356.05322037224
Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours . : 16401.568781719947
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and , having replaced the locket in his bosom , he wiped his eye and sighed again. Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures , how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond , the simple swain and the polished coxcomb , the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years . : 9074.56912758097
But indeed , sir , I wander from the point . : 54440.85962363252
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys . : 20241.868828876974
Maledicity ! : 654070.9864952827
he exclaimed in anguish . : 80619.15170985038
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along ! : 13657.689589358422
I could weep to think of it . : 64034.40137493139
Then , though it had poured seven showers , we were neither of us a penny the worse . : 27737.06796374543
But beshrew me , he cried , clapping hand to his forehead , tomorrow will be a new day and , thousand thunders , I know of a _marchand de capotes_ , Monsieur Poyntz , from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting . : 10536.756046671479
Tut , tut ! : 70202.74128010684
cries Le Fécondateur , tripping in , my friend Monsieur Moore , that most accomplished traveller ( I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town ) , is my authority that in Cape Horn , _ventre biche_ , they have a rain that will wet through any , even the stoutest cloak . : 10927.347649419002
A drenching of that violence , he tells me , _sans blague_ , has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world . : 13799.092929943803
Pooh ! : 654070.9864952827
A _livre ! : 346397.6555345759
_ cries Monsieur Lynch . : 44926.22294796299
The clumsy things are dear at a sou . : 19755.068703041226
One umbrella , were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom , is worth ten such stopgaps . : 18290.469779062852
No woman of any wit would wear one . : 37853.48556301353
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for , as she reminded me ( blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies ) , dame Nature , by the divine blessing , has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb , in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties , is the fittest , nay , the only garment . : inf
The first , said she ( and here my pretty philosopher , as I handed her to her tilbury , to fix my attention , gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear ) , the first is a bath... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge. : 10828.468316316408
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and , while all were conjecturing what might be the cause , Miss Callan entered and , having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon , retired with a profound bow to the company . : 13754.95253313515
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry . : 9795.31247063652
Strike me silly , said Costello , a low fellow who was fuddled. A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh ! : 11768.316597778903
I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you . : 29821.463176544858
What , you dog ? : 55043.96907782593
Have you a way with them ? : 81821.7734662711
Gad’s bud , immensely so , said Mr Lynch . : 18393.302263974158
The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice . : 19210.75148875228
Demme , does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin . : 17561.076288987144
As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months . : 15339.15935805245
Lawksamercy , doctor , cried the young blood in the primrose vest , feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body , how you do tease a body ! : 9944.873629341953
Drat the man ! : 284869.6674662925
Bless me , I’m all of a wibbly wobbly . : 18371.02158843952
Why , you’re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem , that you are ! : 36112.57369448199
May this pot of four half choke me , cried Costello , if she aint in the family way . : 16291.483027416592
I knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her . : 16055.23851628222
The young surgeon , however , rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy . : 12079.917444225837
I want patience , said he , with those who , without wit to enliven or learning to instruct , revile an ennobling profession which , saving the reverence due to the Deity , is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth . : 14172.21398574658
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which , so far from being a byword , should be a glorious incentive in the human breast . : 12292.002864135775
I cannot away with them . : 91496.90528561657
What ? : 1089125.7589536693
Malign such an one , the amiable Miss Callan , who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours ? : 12915.256508804316
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay ? : 14025.266488404743
Perish the thought ! : 70198.21991946433
I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne . : 10972.73138699637
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door . : 25952.46611782807
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado , a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation ( for he swore a round hand ) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath . : 9733.827611645615
Stap my vitals , said he , them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart. : 11454.74667089232
To revert to Mr Bloom who , after his first entry , had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The young sparks , it is true , were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf . : inf
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity , born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world , which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to , so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin . : inf
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and , being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast , he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and , by intercepting them with the readiest precaution , foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at , rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable . : inf
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy ( a habit of mind which he never did hold with ) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that , having lost all forbearance , can lose no more , there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat . : 11179.624935231812
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which , caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe , is ever ( as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it ) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions . : 9663.79973477294
To conclude , while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was , however , it must be owned , not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being. : 13418.334709336914
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour , saying that , to express his notion of the thing , his opinion ( who ought not perchance to express one ) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron . : inf
I must acquaint you , said Mr Crotthers , clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis , old Glory Allelujurum was round again today , an elderly man with dundrearies , preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina , my life , as he calls her . : 11236.805271259851
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon . : 13413.62608516933
’Slife , I’ll be round with you . : 41054.86287825564
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her . : 20082.980977468123
All fell to praising of it , each after his own fashion , though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap , a clerk in orders , a linkboy ( virtuous ) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household . : 10634.484885104246
Singular , communed the guest with himself , the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them , that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity , that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest . : 9500.033348596458
But , he further added , it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together. : 15962.435517587723
But with what fitness , let it be asked of the noble lord , his patron , has this alien , whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights , constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity ? : 12685.941306969899
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled ? : 23358.369261955228
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents ? : 10640.681087812176
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received ? : 30471.6798374211
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is , if report belie him not , his own and his only enjoyer ? : 12695.260043489421
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady , the daughter of a gallant major , or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there ( as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done ) then be it so . : 19516.32245824298
Unhappy woman , she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate . : 23387.075639326595
He says this , a censor of morals , a very pelican in his piety , who did not scruple , oblivious of the ties of nature , to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society ! : 15136.163301513283
Nay , had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel , it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar , the Egyptian ! : 13908.388254090434
In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic . : 12842.861363357057
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel . : 21003.783089869572
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare ? : 20979.584388164938
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life . : 19687.83838042283
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him . : 10840.66570128405
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce . : 14620.020428709407
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which , when rooted in its native orient , throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but , transplanted to a clime more temperate , its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant , acid and inoperative. : 8394.506699242658
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence , who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born . : 9978.09061488035
When he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council , silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates , chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier , broke out at once into a strife of tongues . : inf
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge , to mollify , to refrain . : 16683.970151407
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent . : 12795.185307271151
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers , the Caesarean section , posthumity with respect to the father and , that rarer form , with respect to the mother , the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused , the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets , miscarriages and infanticides , simulated or dissimulated , the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion , the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen ( cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan ) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that ( as he said ) one ear could hear what the other spoke , the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep , the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein , the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid ( as exemplified in the actual case ) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix , artificial insemination by means of syringes , involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause , the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape , that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt , _ the recorded instances of multiseminal , twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations . : inf
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest , by her movement , the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning , ardently and ineffectually entertained , to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation . : inf
The abnormalities of harelip , breastmole , supernumerary digits , negro’s inkle , strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded ( the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten ) or doghaired infants occasionally born . : 9614.020789461914
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory , advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for , envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human . : 10048.815625224774
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views , with such heat as almost carried conviction , the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes , his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses . : 10475.749396153158
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived . : 16576.36425487018
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect , postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man . : 12003.838155306237
Contemporaneously , a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other , the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus . : 10415.776380356154
Hitherto silent , whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice , he delivered briefly and , as some thought , perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined. : 10919.219434666778
But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror . : 37038.47554132174
He conjured up the scene before them . : 40629.697148532294
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared... Haines ! : 14955.170789861657
Which of us did not feel his flesh creep ! : 18378.709128734776
He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand , in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise , horror , loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin . : 12862.261112268907
I anticipated some such reception , he began with an eldritch laugh , for which , it seems , history is to blame . : 17479.24341957902
Yes , it is true . : 37973.35638541675
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs . : 35703.02798480194
And how I am punished ! : 70987.31729394104
The inferno has no terrors for me . : 44204.86254005448
This is the appearance is on me . : 121803.05479137704
Tare and ages , what way would I be resting at all , he muttered thickly , and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus ? : 10392.34714164807
My hell , and Ireland’s , is in this life . : 25500.229240477904
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime . : 41211.87281392166
Distractions , rookshooting , the Erse language ( he recited some ) , laudanum ( he raised the phial to his lips ) , camping out . : 11938.164195835627
In vain ! : 575411.6360567319
His spectre stalks me. Dope is my only hope... Ah ! : 22918.501028114584
Destruction ! : 654070.9864952827
The black panther ! : 65933.15784360672
With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back . : 18139.468660746734
An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven . : 11096.444673580012
He was gone . : 929759.4473673922
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host . : 23662.39861979013
The seer raised his hand to heaven , murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun ! : 14002.714178097975
The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done . : 13115.714685545137
Malachias , overcome by emotion , ceased. The mystery was unveiled . : 15854.755266723292
Haines was the third brother . : 33334.384266150904
His real name was Childs . : 39538.87875068347
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate . : 13799.268033305481
For this relief much thanks . : 91896.55042233708
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited . : 19735.285972879814
No soul will live there . : 69124.86432438677
The spider pitches her web in the solitude . : 29148.795911495807
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole . : 22284.125269596203
A curse is on it . : 58729.43884563256
It is haunted . : 105333.34038303557
Murderer’s ground. : 654070.9864952827
What is the age of the soul of man ? : 71044.4550628833
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach , to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast , so too is her age changeable as her mood . : 9870.348211673365
No longer is Leopold , as he sits there , ruminating , chewing the cud of reminiscence , that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds . : 10809.99912144279
A score of years are blown away . : 36957.609943104806
He is young Leopold . : 52039.184398522244
There , as in a retrospective arrangement , a mirror within a mirror ( hey , presto ! : 16159.665785099169
) , he beholdeth himself . : 69008.48246189635
That young figure of then is seen , precociously manly , walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school , his booksatchel on him bandolierwise , and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf , a mother’s thought . : 9610.825250344466
Or it is the same figure , a year or so gone over , in his first hard hat ( ah , that was a day ! : 18510.61562849952
) , already on the road , a fullfledged traveller for the family firm , equipped with an orderbook , a scented handkerchief ( not for show only ) , his case of bright trinketware ( alas ! : 12525.121746849578
a thing now of the past ! : 40773.12321708986
) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin , shyly acknowledging ( but the heart ? : 11938.590090803875
tell me ! : 254418.16145757266
) his studied baisemoins . : 71026.34885351249
The scent , the smile , but , more than these , the dark eyes and oleaginous address , brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm , seated with Jacob’s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle ( a meal of noodles , you may be sure , is aheating ) , reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before . : 12550.706359665306
But hey , presto , the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes , shrivels , dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist . : 10455.438501882285
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons . : 22575.439515556096
Who can say ? : 200520.8132411387
The wise father knows his own child . : 22276.292716092685
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street , hard by the bonded stores there , the first . : 18773.3665135269
Together ( she is a poor waif , a child of shame , yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny ) , together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university . : 11393.30954715281
Bridie ! : 654070.9864952827
Bridie Kelly ! : 147721.71540071006
He will never forget the name , ever remember the night: first night , the bridenight . : 13288.699016922657
They are entwined in nethermost darkness , the willer with the willed , and in an instant ( _fiat ! : 14831.371062744782
_ ) light shall flood the world . : 37345.595568202545
Did heart leap to heart ? : 51088.103041361486
Nay , fair reader . : 44923.937042095655
In a breath ’twas done but—hold ! : 44345.88502376653
Back ! : 654070.9864952827
It must not be ! : 225476.55803865465
In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk . : 17843.107085228883
She is the bride of darkness , a daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day . : 17948.560999771413
No , Leopold . : 209308.36162780054
Name and memory solace thee not . : 40953.440893636915
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee—and in vain . : 37828.289865810286
No son of thy loins is by thee . : 25599.413044886125
There is none now to be for Leopold , what Leopold was for Rudolph. : 30997.814811838824
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly , silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived . : 10707.066428588285
A region where grey twilight ever descends , never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields , shedding her dusk , scattering a perennial dew of stars . : 11719.27142542131
She follows her mother with ungainly steps , a mare leading her fillyfoal . : 14226.05152611665
Twilight phantoms are they , yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure , slim shapely haunches , a supple tendonous neck , the meek apprehensive skull. They fade , sad phantoms: all is gone . : 11884.849238600738
Agendath is a waste land , a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa . : 13639.397642486458
Netaim , the golden , is no more. And on the highway of the clouds they come , muttering thunder of rebellion , the ghosts of beasts . : 11721.591067957856
Huuh ! : 654070.9864952827
Hark ! : 654070.9864952827
Huuh ! : 654070.9864952827
Parallax stalks behind and goads them , the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions . : 13147.599178650582
Elk and yak , the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon , mammoth and mastodon , they come trooping to the sunken sea , _Lacus Mortis_. Ominous revengeful zodiacal host ! : 10035.298643937693
They moan , passing upon the clouds , horned and capricorned , the trumpeted with the tusked , the lionmaned , the giantantlered , snouter and crawler , rodent , ruminant and pachyderm , all their moving moaning multitude , murderers of the sun. : 9295.164873477319
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink , unslaked and with horrible gulpings , the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood . : 11285.677093455046
And the equine portent grows again , magnified in the deserted heavens , nay to heaven’s own magnitude , till it looms , vast , over the house of Virgo . : 14589.117236703205
And lo , wonder of metempsychosis , it is she , the everlasting bride , harbinger of the daystar , the bride , ever virgin . : 11354.55642588078
It is she , Martha , thou lost one , Millicent , the young , the dear , the radiant . : 12421.728197450773
How serene does she now arise , a queen among the Pleiades , in the penultimate antelucan hour , shod in sandals of bright gold , coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer . : 12454.691473527599
It floats , it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams , emerald , sapphire , mauve and heliotrope , sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind , winding , coiling , simply swirling , writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till , after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol , it blazes , Alpha , a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus. : 8733.169132068933
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee’s time . : 19526.513389585198
He asked about Glaucon , Alcibiades , Pisistratus . : 22049.52324509928
Where were they now ? : 90872.08104666161
Neither knew . : 477952.30475725327
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms , Stephen said . : 35364.35158857975
Why think of them ? : 113476.89852492415
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call ? : 14301.859074517712
Who supposes it ? : 155790.83881717603
I , Bous Stephanoumenos , bullockbefriending bard , am lord and giver of their life . : 15532.760837035874
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves , smiling at Vincent . : 14343.70975389582
That answer and those leaves , Vincent said to him , will adorn you more fitly when something more , and greatly more , than a capful of light odes can call your genius father . : 13144.142648047913
All who wish you well hope this for you . : 35804.04588963582
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate , to acclaim you Stephaneforos . : 17291.726025367712
I heartily wish you may not fail them . : 21776.144032583165
O no , Vincent Lenehan said , laying a hand on the shoulder near him . : 14210.514488648498
Have no fear . : 124448.67152942027
He could not leave his mother an orphan . : 48177.219818643294
The young man’s face grew dark. All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss . : 21744.500795967633
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart . : 18996.831695118057
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more . : 16335.011390867423
He told them of the race . : 29832.214696282335
The flag fell and , huuh ! : 26010.824218943646
off , scamper , the mare ran out freshly with O. Madden up . : 18313.112215824574
She was leading the field . : 44538.66453154225
All hearts were beating . : 71026.34885351249
Even Phyllis could not contain herself . : 87941.72653140844
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah ! : 22936.42753427233
Sceptre wins ! : 147721.71540071006
But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level , reached , outstripped her . : 12449.442586716914
All was lost now . : 143654.0435560547
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones . : 20313.819907579957
Juno , she cried , I am undone . : 25574.70286446571
But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook . : 12916.86360754104
A tear fell: one only . : 51085.90948772254
A whacking fine whip , said Lenehan , is W. Lane . : 19613.88285177128
Four winners yesterday and three today . : 44616.76736810851
What rider is like him ? : 47406.98281485347
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his . : 14493.716196777215
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont . : 16881.91830474763
Mercy on the luckless ! : 44844.34342651141
Poor Sceptre ! : 346397.6555345759
he said with a light sigh . : 111931.61030555353
She is not the filly that she was . : 92021.11411565555
Never , by this hand , shall we behold such another . : 36357.66465338801
By gad , sir , a queen of them . : 41422.19921749652
Do you remember her , Vincent ? : 52265.12261633673
I wish you could have seen my queen today , Vincent said . : 30068.914849400924
How young she was and radiant ( Lalage were scarce fair beside her ) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin , I do not know the right name of it . : 12301.152437613679
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us . : 11174.89966763832
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge . : 10881.936444321349
But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close . : 17234.486389577694
A week ago she lay ill , four days on the couch , but today she was free , blithe , mocked at peril . : 11912.723684672066
She is more taking then. Her posies too ! : 32933.42848878465
Mad romp that she is , she had pulled her fill as we reclined together . : 19469.133569683778
And in your ear , my friend , you will not think who met us as we left the field . : 22343.07473406172
Conmee himself ! : 147721.71540071006
He was walking by the hedge , reading , I think a brevier book with , I doubt not , a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page . : 13722.836395924362
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion , feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her . : 11050.842977319317
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries . : 13040.947175528248
But he had been kind . : 120639.05847942858
In going by he had blessed us . : 24626.56704073901
The gods too are ever kind , Lenehan said . : 25517.28150385468
If I had poor luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely . : 17835.942924426465
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act , pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. Warily , Malachi whispered , preserve a druid silence . : 13796.97569714759
His soul is far away . : 48597.682115369724
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born . : 24771.623653207513
Any object , intensely regarded , may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods . : 18720.352750396072
Do you not think it , Stephen ? : 75005.41602601294
Theosophos told me so , Stephen answered , whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law . : 12936.623700127031
The lords of the moon , Theosophos told me , an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation. : 11077.395292705121
However , as a matter of fact though , the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character , was not the case at all . : 14545.356714414735
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop . : 9707.641632886207
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance . : 10543.366117391914
He was simply and solely , as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself , which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings , after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf , recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn . : 11974.683339885982
Eventually , however , both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with , also at the same time , however , a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place. : inf
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life . : 18580.310346187158
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity . : 30050.406958722833
The debaters were the keenest in the land , the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital . : 13432.902298943134
The high hall of Horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic . : 9876.9690063558
A gallant scene in truth it made . : 45627.7536306021
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb , his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway . : 11467.830032363905
There too , opposite to him , was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom . : 14240.190420902927
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello , the eccentric , while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden . : 10354.894685842613
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan . : 9053.171220825561
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion , while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator , fresh from the hippodrome , and that vigilant wanderer , soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour , but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come. : inf
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus’ ( Div . : 15279.542801134228
Scep . : 654070.9864952827
) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods . : 17087.636016009976
Science , it cannot be too often repeated , deals with tangible phenomena . : 32210.848525853817
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can . : 14486.76880512877
There may be , it is true , some questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom ( Pubb . : 14184.443213974779
Canv . : 654070.9864952827
) regarding the future determination of sex . : 30620.22931666075
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary ( the postmenstrual period , assert others ) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it , as most embryologists incline to opine , such as Culpepper , Spallanzani , Blumenbach , Lusk , Hertwig , Leopold and Valenti , a mixture of both ? : 11514.16456230963
This would be tantamount to a cooperation ( one of nature’s favourite devices ) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position , _succubitus felix_ , of the passive element . : 11339.312044271732
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality . : 15916.88716867343
It is interesting because , as he pertinently remarks , we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways . : 19287.306993321312
Mr M. Mulligan ( Hyg . : 36373.65633906889
et Eug . : 147721.71540071006
Doc . : 654070.9864952827

These factors , he alleged , and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets , hideous publicity posters , religious ministers of all denominations , mutilated soldiers and sailors , exposed scorbutic cardrivers , the suspended carcases of dead animals , paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these , he said , were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race . : 9114.159625759878
Kalipedia , he prophesied , would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life , genuinely good music , agreeable literature , light philosophy , instructive pictures , plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo , artistic coloured photographs of prize babies , all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner . : 10380.569323143685
Mr J. Crotthers ( Disc . : 36373.65633906889
Bacc . : 654070.9864952827
) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect , private or official , culminating in the exposure of newborn infants , the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide . : 9893.85479736331
Although the former ( we are thinking of neglect ) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative . : 9575.756323408137
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do , all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions . : 13730.494514776094
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch ( Bacc . : 14256.035490916214
Arith . : 654070.9864952827
) that both natality and mortality , as well as all other phenomena of evolution , tidal movements , lunar phases , blood temperatures , diseases in general , everything , in fine , in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained . : 9969.023634789972
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood ( though other children of the same marriage do not ) must certainly , in the poet’s words , give us pause . : 9727.055764524292
Nature , we may rest assured , has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence ( modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal ) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development , an arrangement which , though productive of pain to some of our feelings ( notably the maternal ) , is nevertheless , some of us think , in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest . : inf
Mr S. Dedalus’ ( Div . : 36373.65633906889
Scep . : 654070.9864952827
) remark ( or should it be called an interruption ? : 20887.779402115375
) that an omnivorous being which can masticate , deglute , digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition , corpulent professional gentlemen , not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns , might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob , reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to . : 11568.082325952795
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being , it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother . : 12033.853481214634
In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom ( Pubb . : 21189.115952828888
Canv . : 654070.9864952827
) which took place in the commons’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital , <NUM> , <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street , of which , as is well known , Dr A. Horne ( Lic . : 16679.9009613026
in Midw . : 477952.30475725327
, F. K. Q. C. P. I. ) is the able and popular master , he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag ( an esthete’s allusion , presumably , to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress ) she must let it out again or give it life , as he phrased it , to save her own . : 9967.490529727895

The car and horse back slowly , awkwardly , and turn . : 15443.006968387292
Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom’s plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat . : 9946.145010569142
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply . : 41581.11339699502
With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done . : 18745.668970222527
With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs . : 20528.145204875098

Bloom , holding in his hand Stephen’s hat , festooned with shavings , and ashplant , stands irresolute . : 14454.511874360416

— III — : 147721.71540071006
[ <NUM> ] : 147721.71540071006
Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed . : 9646.040012051099
His ( Stephen’s ) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting , off the reel , the propriety of the cabman’s shelter , as it was called , hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral . : inf
But how to get there was the rub . : 29858.425177948477
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned . : 14345.904536850092
So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition , both of them being e.d.ed , particularly Stephen , always assuming that there was such a thing to be found . : 19663.934921504202
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing , in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line , they both walked together along Beaver street or , more properly , lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s . : inf
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler , probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree , outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom , who was anything but a professional whistler , endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle , holding his arms arched over his head , twice. : inf
This was a quandary but , bringing common sense to bear on it , evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did . : 15000.599430165119
So , bevelling around by Mullett’s and the Signal House which they shortly reached , they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus , Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had , to vary the timehonoured adage , gone the way of all buttons though , entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing , he heroically made light of the mischance . : 11101.180190606701
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time , as it happened , and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius , they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey . : 12851.978643389768
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back . : 11570.999720358423
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station , the starting point for Belfast , where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue ( a not very enticing locality , not to say gruesome to a degree , more especially at night ) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street , famous for its C division police station . : 10946.63631583399
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen , associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot place , first turning on the right , while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke’s city bakery , situated quite close to where they were , the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread , of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable . : inf
Bread , the staff of life , earn your bread , O tell me where is fancy bread , at Rourke’s the baker’s it is said. : 12149.330591968417
_En route_ to his taciturn and , not to put too fine a point on it , not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties , never more so , in fact disgustingly sober , spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown , women of ill fame and swell mobsmen , which , barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice , was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out . : inf
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or , failing that , the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or , he being the solicitor rather , old Wall , he meant to say , or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about . : inf
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen , whom he cordially disliked , were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and , as Mr Bloom put it , recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street , prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot . : 10488.464953309645
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city , Pembroke road for example , the guardians of the law were well in evidence , the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes . : 12815.540335198755
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything . : 11971.89598852513
You frittered away your time , he very sensibly maintained , and health and also character besides which , the squandermania of the thing , fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £. s . : 13551.286621929576
d . : 654070.9864952827
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though , touching the much vexed question of stimulants , he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues ( notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in ) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically . : inf
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one , a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs. : 15471.341443538491
—And that one was Judas , Stephen said , who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind. : 11766.471964534987
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps . : 10055.013149518132
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox . : 11762.81585990152
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father’s , Gumley . : 13231.298851337353
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge. : 15609.195447391372
—Someone saluted you , Mr Bloom said. : 26952.23533646737
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again , calling: : 15432.215962800563
—Night ! : 654070.9864952827
Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment . : 14968.552565071475
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least . : 11878.490152728464
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper , famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice , your money or your life , leaving you there to point a moral , gagged and garrotted. : inf
Stephen , that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters , though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice . : 14181.263587052079
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise . : 20987.27842663879
He was the eldest son of inspector Corley of the G division , lately deceased , who had married a certain Katherine Brophy , the daughter of a Louth farmer . : 16055.097884206825
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine ( also ) Talbot. Rumour had it ( though not proved ) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion , really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing , her mother or aunt or some relative , a woman , as the tale went , of extreme beauty , had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen . : inf
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley. : 15492.551774177773
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings . : 13366.716236039303
His friends had all deserted him . : 37224.181211121235
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions . : 15491.89473319337
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God’s earth he could get something , anything at all , to do . : 24462.075734358834
No , it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way , both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish . : 15254.348299804496
Anyhow he was all in. : 44828.49410647639
—I wouldn’t ask you only , pursued he , on my solemn oath and God knows I’m on the rocks. : 11764.772199692054
—There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day , Stephen told him , in a boys’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher . : 16189.243083734204
Mr Garrett Deasy . : 79916.93337949764
Try it . : 195249.81019365854
You may mention my name. : 57524.579009847774
—Ah , God , Corley replied , sure I couldn’t teach in a school , man . : 15660.720895638859
I was never one of your bright ones , he added with a half laugh . : 24233.3004123787
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers. : 16512.52919605027
—I have no place to sleep myself , Stephen informed him. : 16957.361727573927
Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street . : 16919.886650555192
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street , Mrs Maloney’s , but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street ( which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon ) for a bob . : 13402.227210229274
He was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it. : 35681.02711067047
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence . : 13847.494688607941
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished . : 11910.413761877171
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful. Whereas . : 14192.934506962345
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for , to his chagrin , he found his cash missing . : 12755.954347441173
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation . : 32476.563983842727
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout , very much the reverse in fact . : 15244.729724286024
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect . : 19015.103897712506
About biscuits he dimly remembered . : 60011.420715940854
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy . : 15915.671945851724
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies , erroneously however , as it turned out. : 13531.967364231903
—Those are halfcrowns , man , Corley corrected him. : 20312.63212439745
And so in point of fact they turned out to be . : 46498.40670561599
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them. : 26966.387922818838
—Thanks , Corley answered , you’re a gentleman . : 20314.63557293002
I’ll pay you back one time . : 60044.77588573697
Who’s that with you ? : 111727.41189936856
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan , the billsticker . : 17180.781435766345
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there . : 19237.26610193222
I’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks , man . : 19423.281754945772
God , you’ve to book ahead , man , you’d think it was for the Carl Rosa . : 21495.477918535733
I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job , even as a crossing sweeper. : 20074.551275654703
Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s , the shipchandler’s , bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe . : 11584.978017288238
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable. : 16538.85842359082
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work , it struck him , was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept . : 12367.914589367543
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when . : 14688.580144987172
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity . : 10467.840332018211
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round , in every deep , so to put it , a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether . : 14125.229845390693
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning . : 15513.039003589849
Pretty thick that was certainly. : 44914.75893046972
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who , with his practised eye , was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite . : 15395.568780492122
Alluding to the encounter he said , laughingly , Stephen , that is: : 17526.047317539338
—He is down on his luck . : 26959.669342509544
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan , a billsticker , to give him a job as a sandwichman. : 15907.595968256786
At this intelligence , in which he seemingly evinced little interest , Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger , rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana , moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair , whereupon he observed evasively: : 11711.227345933756
—Everybody gets their own ration of luck , they say . : 23355.01024655291
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me . : 35757.71466452168
But , leaving that for the moment , how much did you part with , he queried , if I am not too inquisitive ? : 18679.083145671324
—Half a crown , Stephen responded . : 26974.43105546525
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere. : 22237.977109904816
—Needs ! : 654070.9864952827
Mr Bloom ejaculated , professing not the least surprise at the intelligence , I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does . : 13196.500260599034
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds . : 25778.208666865852
But , talking about things in general , where , added he with a smile , will you sleep yourself ? : 19045.260604705094
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question . : 34061.79560707365
And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station . : 16639.124712326186
Simply fag out there for nothing . : 37410.19367284277
I don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house ? : 14390.851940394194
—To seek misfortune , was Stephen’s answer. : 26932.161271021247
—I met your respected father on a recent occasion , Mr Bloom diplomatically returned , today in fact , or to be strictly accurate , on yesterday . : 12294.821529740875
Where does he live at present ? : 73784.43540575172
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved. : 20833.101197801592
—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere , Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why ? : 19625.61964202873
—A gifted man , Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior , in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one . : 13604.19138803698
He takes great pride , quite legitimate , out of you . : 34290.505802342355
You could go back perhaps , he hasarded , still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two , Mulligan , that is , and that English tourist friend of his , who eventually euchred their third companion , were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion , which they did. : 10373.293210045695
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however , such as it was , Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle , her hair hanging down , waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy , Boody and Katey , the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper , in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded , it being quarter tense or if not , ember days or something like that. : inf
—No , Mr Bloom repeated again , I wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element , Dr Mulligan , as a guide , philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes . : 11976.543757446057
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did . : 19769.98649331819
But it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object. : 11663.62313492721
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man , by no means confined to medicine only , who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and , if the report was verified , bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries , or Malahide was it ? : inf
, was , he was bound to admit , an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise , so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy , pure and simple. : 12273.341865819846
—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains , he ventured to throw out. : 12901.461749697448
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light , none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less . : inf
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that , high educational abilities though he possessed , he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet. : 11402.609554277935
Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way , there being some little differences between the parties. : 9927.488361423355
—_Puttana madonna , che ci dia i quattrini ! : 20317.500783260028
Ho ragione ? : 147721.71540071006
Culo rotto ! : 147721.71540071006
_ : 56776224.999992244
_—Intendiamoci . : 654070.9864952827
Mezzo sovrano più..._ : 147721.71540071006
_—Dice lui , però ! : 44926.22294796299
_ : 56776224.999992244
_—Mezzo._ : 56776224.999992244
_—Farabutto ! : 654070.9864952827
Mortacci sui ! : 147721.71540071006
_ : 56776224.999992244
_—Ma ascolta ! : 147721.71540071006
Cinque la testa più..._ : 70202.74128010684
Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter , an unpretentious wooden structure , where , prior to then , he had rarely if ever been before , the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat Fitzharris , the invincible , though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in . : 11648.704398523596
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity. : 10084.32770173448
—Now touching a cup of coffee , Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice , it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food , say , a roll of some description. : 11751.79693679587
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly . : 18334.23542819755
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied , away though one redbearded bibulous individual , portion of whose hair was greyish , a sailor probably , still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor . : 9333.817911701228
Mr Bloom , availing himself of the right of free speech , he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute , though , to be sure , rather in a quandary over _voglio_ , remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: : 10730.534824689257
—A beautiful language . : 70202.74128010684
I mean for singing purposes . : 31908.903151080485
Why do you not write your poetry in that language ? : 20488.090442637553
_Bella Poetria_ ! : 147721.71540071006
It is so melodious and full . : 34006.09639839375
_Belladonna . : 654070.9864952827
Voglio._ : 56776224.999992244
Stephen , who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could , suffering from lassitude generally , replied: : 14164.326446543779
—To fill the ear of a cow elephant . : 20296.39625967085
They were haggling over money. : 71301.34310512841
—Is that so ? : 118106.36008021973
Mr Bloom asked . : 79916.93337949764
Of course , he subjoined pensively , at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary , it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it. : 18188.877271512778
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête-à-tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun , or so it seemed. After which he beat a retreat to his counter , Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to . : 12439.309555305119
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him. : 12814.04681655738
—Sounds are impostures , Stephen said after a pause of some little time , like names . : 31597.300942955568
Cicero , Podmore , Napoleon , Mr Goodbody . : 20317.590926335102
Jesus , Mr Doyle. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies . : 16964.332524729798
What’s in a name ? : 90705.1553436147
—Yes , to be sure , Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred . : 23526.384170666963
Of course . : 1546212.916836745
Our name was changed too , he added , pushing the socalled roll across. : 19226.917994979467
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen , whom he had singled out for attention in particular , squarely by asking: : 12592.616612224156
—And what might your name be ? : 40955.55596573493
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but Stephen , apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter , answered: : 10612.006234485705
—Dedalus. : 56776224.999992244
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes , rather bunged up from excessive use of boose , preferably good old Hollands and water. : 11473.874069285863
—You know Simon Dedalus ? : 44926.22294796299
he asked at length. : 145797.2524796239
—I’ve heard of him , Stephen said. : 52063.22708698649
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment , seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too. : 17365.653106587353
—He’s Irish , the seaman bold affirmed , staring still in much the same way and nodding . : 17680.06586549599
All Irish. : 2055530.0980201538
—All too Irish , Stephen rejoined. : 33362.90043662681
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: : 12893.47807117132
—I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder . : 13163.553956650338
The lefthand dead shot. : 65933.15784360672
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain. : 13140.327146492798
—Bottles out there , say . : 59989.67235097394
Fifty yards measured . : 70202.74128010684
Eggs on the bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder . : 16950.40879551533
Aims. : 56776224.999992244
He turned his body half round , shut up his right eye completely . : 15025.672499518549
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance. : 14036.607746366859
—Pom ! : 654070.9864952827
he then shouted once. : 145797.13537069436
The entire audience waited , anticipating an additional detonation , there being still a further egg. : 12957.809763388972
—Pom ! : 654070.9864952827
he shouted twice. : 391465.5197423517
Egg two evidently demolished , he nodded and winked , adding bloodthirstily: : 15843.253072607075
_—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill , : 33362.90043662681
Never missed nor he never will._ : 60001.142780413815
A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley. : 18874.91258895295
—Beg pardon , the sailor said. : 33270.38739123748
—Long ago ? : 147721.71540071006
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth. : 29047.917451335474
—Why , the sailor replied , relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond , it might be a matter of ten years . : 13361.338925994127
He toured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus . : 19804.669937441962
I seen him do that in Stockholm. : 25956.945761586336
—Curious coincidence , Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively. : 20317.590926335102
—Murphy’s my name , the sailor continued . : 35649.70646389137
D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe. Know where that is ? : 26163.853374895032
—Queenstown harbour , Stephen replied. : 44926.22294796299
—That’s right , the sailor said . : 44511.52114801717
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle . : 33362.90043662681
That’s where I hails from . : 33359.31899834314
I belongs there . : 116413.67067874693
That’s where I hails from . : 33359.31899834314
My little woman’s down there . : 64135.82209247082
She’s waiting for me , I know . : 72754.92024829845
_For England , home and beauty_. She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years now , sailing about. : 11523.921103330613
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene , the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones , a rainy night with a blind moon . : 11281.486947528609
Across the world for a wife . : 121973.65501519624
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic , Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O’Leary , a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way. Never about the runaway wife coming back , however much devoted to the absentee . : 10419.525832612422
The face at the window ! : 31956.762685119207
Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half , wrecked in his affections . : 10348.465973591245
You little expected me but I’ve come to stay and make a fresh start . : 18760.908913965795
There she sits , a grasswidow , at the selfsame fireside . : 21495.46798193891
Believes me dead , rocked in the cradle of the deep . : 15784.189225391197
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin , as the case might be , the publican of the Crown and Anchor , in shirtsleeves , eating rumpsteak and onions . : 13607.920255085928
No chair for father . : 68106.93699619922
Broo ! : 654070.9864952827
The wind ! : 135865.98758199185
Her brandnew arrival is on her knee , _post mortem_ child . : 24121.909314071414
With a high ro ! : 62248.42088777621
and a randy ro ! : 60811.12048671972
and my galloping tearing tandy , O ! : 27796.731968963348
Bow to the inevitable . : 44729.69270582065
Grin and bear it . : 53108.6545575547
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W. B. Murphy. : 16556.534333900057
The sailor , who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident , turned to one of the jarvies with the request: : 18538.932723552298
—You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you ? : 28343.527384570934
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand. : 9716.432524566882
—Thank you , the sailor said. : 33242.51224870144
He deposited the quid in his gob and , chewing and with some slow stammers , proceeded: : 13291.81237533607
—We come up this morning eleven o’clock . : 22997.690033213985
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks . : 22289.15306492247
I shipped to get over . : 31893.223769029533
Paid off this afternoon . : 44925.06562279552
There’s my discharge . : 70202.74128010684
See ? : 654070.9864952827
D. B. Murphy . : 70202.74128010684
A. B. S. : 147721.71540071006
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document. : 13602.591537883276
—You must have seen a fair share of the world , the keeper remarked , leaning on the counter. : 21454.13243146055
—Why , the sailor answered upon reflection upon it , I’ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on . : 17268.12454411143
I was in the Red Sea . : 66942.50671566608
I was in China and North America and South America . : 24616.225309643865
We was chased by pirates one voyage . : 31660.490537917343
I seen icebergs plenty , growlers . : 25964.55680201885
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea , the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton , the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship . : 14575.759516924754
I seen Russia . : 65668.05553403238
_Gospodi pomilyou_. That’s how the Russians prays. : 26974.43105546525
—You seen queer sights , don’t be talking , put in a jarvey. : 14961.484689928879
—Why , the sailor said , shifting his partially chewed plug . : 15831.375231491731
I seen queer things too , ups and downs . : 17911.9060170535
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid. : 12941.197509382611
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and , lodging it between his teeth , bit ferociously: : 18132.263453262985
—Khaan ! : 654070.9864952827
Like that . : 147696.34304491166
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses . : 14608.556765719879
Look here . : 477892.7537728085
Here they are . : 408293.8777904044
A friend of mine sent me. : 51084.812110348896
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios . : 11980.611826513305
Beni , Bolivia._ : 147721.71540071006
All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited , a group of savage women in striped loincloths , squatted , blinking , suckling , frowning , sleeping amid a swarm of infants ( there must have been quite a score of them ) outside some primitive shanties of osier. : 11251.549978852248
—Chews coca all day , the communicative tarpaulin added . : 18364.758970063034
Stomachs like breadgraters . : 70202.74128010684
Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more children. : 16958.205962929533
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver raw. : 15854.925469898655
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more. : 13524.693919266512
—Know how to keep them off ? : 44599.538599954336
he inquired generally. : 391465.5197423517
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked , saying: : 22999.514245861126
—Glass . : 654070.9864952827
That boggles ’em . : 118091.04869746098
Glass. : 56776224.999992244
Mr Bloom , without evincing surprise , unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark . : 11811.086136518374
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal , Señor A Boudin , Galeria Becche , Santiago , Chile._ There was no message evidently , as he took particular notice. Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated ( or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat ) having detected a discrepancy between his name ( assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t . : inf
somewhere ) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest . : inf
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through . : 10137.735924941866
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so dear , purse permitting , a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six , there and back . : 9525.691218921826
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable , especially for a chap whose liver was out of order , seeing the different places along the route , Plymouth , Falmouth , Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis , the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement , tower , abbey , wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with . : inf
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts , Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas , Eastbourne , Scarborough , Margate and so on , beautiful Bournemouth , the Channel islands and similar bijou spots , which might prove highly remunerative . : 10674.747468240022
Not , of course , with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job , witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise and I’ll post you the ticket . : 11867.716107687675
No , something top notch , an all star Irish caste , the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners , perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success , providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure . : 10967.577837364419
But who ? : 145487.9791204644
That was the rub. : 117954.8707695834
Also , without being actually positive , it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which , it was mooted , was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally . : 10564.779106002965
A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large , the average man , i.e . : 11507.282745920846
Brown , Robinson and Co. : 44926.22294796299
It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street , when the system really needed toning up , for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife . : 14214.981234520423
After all , hang it , they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island , delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation , offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even , Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram , but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow , rightly termed the garden of Ireland , an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down , and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d’œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise , Silken Thomas , Grace O’Malley , George IV , rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy , though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally , usually , by the way , on their left leg , it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar . : inf
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy , so to speak , and the accommodation left much to be desired . : 12039.698898636305
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity , pure and simple , was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact . : 11419.42948002829
He turned back the other side of the card , picture , and passed it along to Stephen. : 18371.73300383487
—I seen a Chinese one time , related the doughty narrator , that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different . : 12389.911018948487
One was a ship , another was a house , another was a flower . : 21815.027102471195
Cooks rats in your soup , he appetisingly added , the chinks does. : 14941.211021484945
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on , adhering to his adventures. : 13879.748800257132
—And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap . : 14969.722043932104
Knife in his back . : 44859.3200417364
Knife like that. : 147721.71540071006
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position. : 15934.210309448752
—In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow hid behind a door , come up behind him . : 11711.512774989944
Like that . : 147696.34304491166
_Prepare to meet your God_ , says he . : 20314.64243195421
Chuk ! : 654070.9864952827
It went into his back up to the butt. : 29009.73744032419
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to. : 12387.532887409774
—That’s a good bit of steel , repeated he , examining his formidable _stiletto_. : 14252.949630808125
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors , otherwise pocket. : 10484.983100478066
—They’re great for the cold steel , somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all . : 24879.37786134849
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives. : 15025.09472829266
At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is bliss_ Mr B. and Stephen , each in his own particular way , both instinctively exchanged meaning glances , in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however , towards where Skin-the-Goat , _alias_ the keeper , not turning a hair , was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair . : 9812.437784498468
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art , a perfect study in itself , beggaring description , conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on. Funny , very ! : 13391.385923243224
There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause . : 35423.83060168997
One man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal , another the card with the natives _choza de_ , another the seaman’s discharge . : 11569.905703648139
Mr Bloom , so far as he was personally concerned , was just pondering in pensive mood . : 28874.29948522656
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday , roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles , when it took the civilised world by storm , figuratively speaking , early in the eighties , eightyone to be correct , when he was just turned fifteen. : 10917.849637420717
—Ay , boss , the sailor broke in . : 20281.0927916094
Give us back them papers. : 44926.22294796299
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape. : 15516.321518638546
—Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar ? : 22998.773647463975
Mr Bloom inquired. : 175586.31393135735
The sailor grimaced , chewing , in a way that might be read as yes , ay or no. : 14991.333946181629
—Ah , you’ve touched there too , Mr Bloom said , Europa point , thinking he had , in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so , simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust , and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn. : 14290.686731466974
—What year would that be about ? : 26973.934713100607
Mr B interrogated . : 79916.93337949764
Can you recall the boats ? : 54306.40900070706
Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: : 20317.500783260028
—I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea , he said , and boats and ships. Salt junk all the time. : 15265.010673851264
Tired seemingly , he ceased . : 33312.3468540509
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer , fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe , suffice it to say that , as a casual glance at the map revealed , it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves . : 13063.127095173324
On more than one occasion , a dozen at the lowest , near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt , evidently derelict , seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall , staring quite obliviously at it and it at him , dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings . : 9755.495811511775
And it left him wondering why . : 51605.67363937492
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself , floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under , well , not exactly under , tempting the fates . : 15121.74516859536
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all . : 20378.5948222771
Nevertheless , without going into the _minutiae_ of the business , the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large , no matter where living inland or seaside , as the case might be , having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights , Kish and others , liable to capsize at any moment , rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy , not to say stormy , weather. : inf
—There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_ , the old seadog , himself a rover , proceeded , went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month . : 12569.069592898326
Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife . : 15665.649486401207
I’m game for that job , shaving and brushup . : 18397.228810805325
I hate roaming about . : 86145.14746461067
There’s my son now , Danny , run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money. : 11329.17250838205
—What age is he ? : 74918.56664002812
queried one hearer who , by the way , seen from the side , bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell , the townclerk , away from the carking cares of office , unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage. : 11285.457493163309
—Why , the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance , my son , Danny ? : 13142.818039865722
He’d be about eighteen now , way I figure it. : 18395.83492638104
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor. : 10212.146893354908
—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater , he remarked , sure as nuts. I must get a wash tomorrow or next day . : 13724.105768403106
It’s them black lads I objects to . : 33143.78657707961
I hate those buggers . : 42585.956778396656
Suck your blood dry , they does. : 26959.907941868612
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather. : 13439.852250262255
—Tattoo , the exhibitor explained . : 54169.77715806892
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton . : 16314.954642294171
Fellow , the name of Antonio , done that . : 22615.601477152504
There he is himself , a Greek. : 35358.19057967378
—Did it hurt much doing it ? : 30667.072373529332
one asked the sailor. : 70198.21991946433
That worthy , however , was busily engaged in collecting round the. Someway in his . : 25742.645740426062
Squeezing or. : 654070.9864952827
—See here , he said , showing Antonio . : 32214.35339546616
There he is cursing the mate . : 35401.138888424146
And there he is now , he added , the same fellow , pulling the skin with his fingers , some special knack evidently , and he laughing at a yarn. : 21322.736884192018
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat , who this time stretched over. : 12517.520882318868
—Ay , ay , sighed the sailor , looking down on his manly chest . : 13659.457019109592
He’s gone too . : 70193.69768501108
Ate by sharks after . : 44925.06562279552
Ay , ay. : 147721.71540071006
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before. : 13749.91124556582
—Neat bit of work , one longshoreman said. : 22993.254494280485
—And what’s the number for ? : 51091.44801640921
loafer number two queried. : 70202.74128010684
—Eaten alive ? : 147721.71540071006
a third asked the sailor. : 44921.593528021236
—Ay , ay , sighed again the latter personage , more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number . : 11717.06172410358
Ate . : 654070.9864952827
A Greek he was. : 133030.74467174814
And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end: : 23147.66259205185
—As bad as old Antonio , For he left me on my ownio. : 25738.2349156813
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill . : 12419.565829593517
Mr Bloom , scarcely knowing which way to look , turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm , and , picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey , if such he was , had laid aside , he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink . : 12181.779289925113
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay , the partially idiotic female , namely , of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you ( Mrs B. ) and begged the chance of his washing . : 10604.364482557557
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not , your washing . : 14970.004849132687
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink ( hers were , that is ) if they really loved him , that is to say , love me , love my dirty shirt . : 11199.484674632677
Still just then , being on tenterhooks , he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off . : 11407.294642368224
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there , viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her. : 13839.180826816204
—The gunboat , the keeper said. : 33274.67442412912
—It beats me , Mr Bloom confided to Stephen , medically I am speaking , how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses , if he values his health in the least . : 12173.998287860053
Unfortunate creature ! : 147721.71540071006
Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Still no matter what the cause is from... : 14036.197208175035
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders , merely remarking: : 21254.76269808026
—In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade . : 17305.127127260235
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul . : 13160.085631328056
She is a bad merchant . : 65215.25213643199
She buys dear and sells cheap. : 33240.938853242464
The elder man , though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude , said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp ( quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject ) , a necessary evil , were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities , a thing , he could truthfully state , he , as a _paterfamilias_ , was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start . : inf
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort , he said , and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned. : 14026.959731334764
—You as a good catholic , he observed , talking of body and soul , believe in the soul . : 11751.080037688638
Or do you mean the intelligence , the brainpower as such , as distinct from any outside object , the table , let us say , that cup . : 16107.251454168834
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter . : 21589.987761562068
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays , for instance . : 16779.547708828708
Do you ? : 1193931.5099314211
Thus cornered , Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: : 14323.241155988118
—They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible . : 14967.94880540843
It would be immortal , I understand , but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who , from all I can hear , is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes , _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette. : 13366.873682671587
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple , promptly rejoining: : 12565.782488872352
—Simple ? : 654070.9864952827
I shouldn’t think that is the proper word . : 40335.89469895289
Of course , I grant you , to concede a point , you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon . : 21743.815477993165
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison , though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man , I mean , and the same applies to the laws , for example , of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God. : inf
—O that , Stephen expostulated , has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ , apart from circumstantial evidence. : 13560.221779468724
On this knotty point however the views of the pair , poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages , clashed. : 15127.162764750705
—Has been ? : 147721.71540071006
the more experienced of the two objected , sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief . : 20086.888739452865
I’m not so sure about that. That’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and , without dragging in the sectarian side of the business , I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there . : 15750.673549430596
My belief is , to tell you the candid truth , that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again , who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon , as , you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I , of course I needn’t tell you . : 13853.321579834226
Can’t you drink that coffee , by the way ? : 40198.22848815571
Let me stir it . : 139986.33421754497
And take a piece of that bun . : 40554.91813175887
It’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised . : 20310.469367297304
Still no-one can give what he hasn’t got . : 20311.53401546133
Try a bit. : 147721.71540071006
—Couldn’t , Stephen contrived to get out , his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further. : 18277.576956371584
Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance ( and lucrative ) work . : 10122.180918117474
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good , shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night , concerts , dramatic evenings and useful lectures ( admittance free ) by qualified men for the lower orders . : 12644.081213316475
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife , Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time , a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying . : 13669.114829562144
The idea , he was strongly inclined to believe , was to do good and net a profit , there being no competition to speak of . : 23863.584379767333
Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where . : 11176.39837048268
Anyhow inspection , medical inspection , of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved. : 16506.548695168352
—Have a shot at it now , he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred. : 15630.658902537236
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage. : 10712.320977519801
—Still it’s solid food , his good genius urged , I’m a stickler for solid food , his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work , mental or manual . : 9450.199134481489
You ought to eat more solid food . : 26844.25443196537
You would feel a different man. : 41000.55417976723
—Liquids I can eat , Stephen said . : 35700.50326983318
But O , oblige me by taking away that knife . : 16893.526764588707
I can’t look at the point of it . : 27842.026853915853
It reminds me of Roman history. : 35099.46723382957
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article , a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye , observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it. : 12085.223170119049
—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself , Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_. Do you think they are genuine ? : 10615.739804582976
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots . : 12889.009670129519
Look at him. : 147721.71540071006
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel. : 12913.781189857378
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him . : 21891.097712000053
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina , if a trifle prone to baldness , there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity . : 10997.401620360211
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told , as people often did about others , namely , that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage ( no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet ) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described . : inf
On the other hand he might be only bluffing , a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs , Dublin residents , like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera . : 11418.483127449657
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him. : 11979.46978875854
—Mind you , I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention , he resumed. Analogous scenes are occasionally , if not often , met with . : 12532.866660150929
Giants , though that is rather a far cry , you see once in a way , Marcella the midget queen . : 14886.193524226861
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs , as they are called , sitting bowlegged , they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here , you see , he proceeded , indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee , were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up , being adored as gods . : 11334.583972353266
There’s an example again of simple souls. : 26972.94199183353
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures ( who reminded him a bit of Ludwig , _alias_ Ledwidge , when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_ , a stupendous success , and his host of admirers came in large numbers , everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort , phantom or the reverse , on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains ) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it , he conceded . : inf
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and , he added , on the cheap. : inf
—Spaniards , for instance , he continued , passionate temperaments like that , impetuous as Old Nick , are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen . : 10612.467310342241
It comes from the great heat , climate generally. My wife is , so to speak , Spanish , half that is . : 14480.401485792008
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted , having been born in ( technically ) Spain , i.e . : 12653.256894783053
Gibraltar . : 654070.9864952827
She has the Spanish type . : 59781.80428022876
Quite dark , regular brunette , black . : 22999.514245861126
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character . : 25476.536562812114
That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian. : 15849.888104486457
—The temperaments at the door , Stephen interposed with , were very passionate about ten shillings . : 15477.05523529954
_Roberto ruba roba sua_. : 70202.74128010684
—Quite so , Mr Bloom dittoed. : 33352.40697657168
—Then , Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere , we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino. : 10457.159922419778
—It’s in the blood , Mr Bloom acceded at once . : 26262.58379266866
All are washed in the blood of the sun . : 23009.939040682308
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today , shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it , and I was just looking at those antique statues there . : 13797.93303926452
The splendid proportions of hips , bosom . : 22289.15306492247
You simply don’t knock against those kind of women here . : 36014.033419921594
An exception here and there . : 48858.15518017023
Handsome yes , pretty in a way you find but what I’m talking about is the female form . : 12043.76953471411
Besides they have so little taste in dress , most of them , which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty , no matter what you say . : 12812.749695066173
Rumpled stockings , it may be , possibly is , a foible of mine but still it’s a thing I simply hate to see. : 15099.345582408878
Interest , however , was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea , ships lost in a fog , collisions with icebergs , all that sort of thing . : 12376.613029587163
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say . : 32868.239890890894
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon , a kind of wind , in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing , he declared , stood to him or words to that effect , a pious medal he had that saved him. : 10705.0606858266
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock , wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand . : 11610.129106563752
That was the talk of the town that year ( Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_ ) , breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror . : 10743.566405988007
Then someone said something about the case of the s . : 30384.88805351823
s . : 2819820.512769662
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck . : 10481.98533972373
No aid was given . : 137770.17066398554
Her master , the _Mona_’s , said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way . : 30091.01702552858
She had no water , it appears , in her hold. : 32609.996861261814
At this stage an incident happened . : 34054.96105930663
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat. : 16236.836649905741
—Let me cross your bows mate , he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze. : 14179.847847008994
He made tracks heavily , slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door , stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left . : 13845.944359136654
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior , saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and , applying its nozzle to his lips , take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise . : 10684.87922836775
The irrepressible Bloom , who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes , could by straining just perceive him , when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit , gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved . : inf
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor , evidently giving it a wide berth , eased himself closer at hand , the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank . : 10593.207137552798
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled . : 18227.83902264852
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who , though now broken down and fast breaking up , was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid , now practically on the parish rates , given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus , a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of . : inf
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver . : 21712.674299290327
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if , however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality. : 11806.414468917545
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping , coastwise and foreign as well , which was all part and parcel of the same thing . : 15666.06059378326
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin , the only launch that year . : 13777.072118022272
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called. : 16964.66823466252
There were wrecks and wreckers , the keeper said , who was evidently _au fait_. : 16322.879413143444
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that , eh ? : 11922.605128032792
Ask the then captain , he advised them , how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day’s work , Captain John Lever of the Lever Line. : 11555.044075138341
—Am I right , skipper ? : 33360.03514451585
he queried of the sailor , now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions. : 21808.184470434262
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds . : 11468.853831667335
Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably ( which it was ) , so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question . : 12949.045113963244
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-_cum_-potation , introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_ , boisterously trolling , like a veritable son of a seacook: : 11747.48089038029
—The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse. O , Johnny Lever ! : 11525.888502658665
Johnny Lever , O ! : 44926.22294796299
After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided . : 11167.472407079536
Skin-the-Goat , assuming he was he , evidently with an axe to grind , was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God’s earth , far and away superior to England , with coal in large quantities , six million pounds worth of pork exported every year , ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein . : inf
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact . : 16152.796401954323
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil , he stated , and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco . : 13540.278591880986
Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon ? : 23366.547423010314
But a day of reckoning , he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice , thoroughly monopolising all the conversation , was in store for mighty England , despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes . : 15907.095981935392
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history . : 22443.629148890006
The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin , he affirmed . : 15527.369032652236
The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland , her Achilles heel , which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles , the Greek hero , a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot . : 9264.689192445567
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland , Parnell said , could not spare a single one of her sons. : 12196.770787779391
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_. The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings , undismayed. : 12360.432655435301
—Take a bit of doing , boss , retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism. : 13255.26563548036
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view. : 12567.221890172792
—Who’s the best troops in the army ? : 35609.81875891291
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated . : 38866.881307370815
And the best jumpers and racers ? : 31192.37306188228
And the best admirals and generals we’ve got ? : 22748.095748215557
Tell me that. : 147715.37312887836
—The Irish , for choice , retorted the cabby like Campbell , facial blemishes apart. : 13656.817947255702
—That’s right , the old tarpaulin corroborated . : 22951.665966117645
The Irish catholic peasant . : 42726.73947819277
He’s the backbone of our empire . : 26970.47116842431
You know Jem Mullins ? : 57536.40976533793
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire , ours or his , and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it . : 10798.46163517535
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter , both , needless to say , appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows. : 11691.215007953737
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for , pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for , he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel , unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for , rather concealed their strength than the opposite . : 10476.88011769446
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if , as time went on , that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies , equally relevant to the issue , might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart . : inf
Another little interesting point , the amours of whores and chummies , to put it in common parlance , reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her , more so , in fact . : 13165.845624752663
And now , why ? : 111363.53404990256
So the scene between the pair of them , the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris , the famous invincible , and the other , obviously bogus , reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick , supposing , that is , it was prearranged as the lookeron , a student of the human soul if anything , the others seeing least of the game . : 12729.551970029492
And as for the lessee or keeper , who probably wasn’t the other person at all , he ( B. ) couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting , there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like Denis or Peter Carey , an idea he utterly repudiated . : inf
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet , though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form , he certainly did feel and no denying it ( while inwardly remaining what he was ) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife , cold steel , with the courage of his political convictions ( though , personally , he would never be a party to any such thing ) , off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south , have her or swing for her , when the husband frequently , after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal ( he having had the pair watched ) , inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her , until it just struck him that Fitz , nicknamed Skin-the-Goat , merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not , if he was reliably informed , actually party to the ambush which , in point of fact , was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on . : inf
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend , the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera , he had transparently outlived his welcome . : 15532.464677058944
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high . : 23259.313327610504
Like actresses , always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again. Generous to a fault of course , temperamental , no economising or any idea of the sort , always snapping at the bone for the shadow . : 11285.01314672745
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £. s . : 23732.507287154767
d . : 654070.9864952827
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern , come back to Erin and so on . : 15965.401620223363
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender. : 19001.84242371449
—He took umbrage at something or other , that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared , I let slip . : 21698.51622350508
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively . : 19292.74695572958
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God , I mean Christ , was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I’m not . : 15675.171350066834
That was one for him. A soft answer turns away wrath . : 18855.901199356886
He hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw . : 30312.27361286249
Am I not right ? : 44925.06562279552
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly. : 11258.514270670223
—_Ex quibus_ , Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent , their two or four eyes conversing , _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other , _secundum carnem_. : 10043.978600602608
—Of course , Mr B. proceeded to stipulate , you must look at both sides of the question . : 15052.506137412607
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country , they say , our own distressful included , has the government it deserves . : 9626.198975771664
But with a little goodwill all round . : 35465.82022158725
It’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality . : 17278.358814670515
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form . : 16554.812058146785
It never reaches anything or stops anything . : 23892.038219178598
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan . : 23736.870215395877
It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular , in the next house so to speak. : 14474.684313929838
—Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war , Stephen assented , between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market. : 12372.875215739514
Yes , Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed , entirely endorsing the remark , that was overwhelmingly right . : 15659.579246483927
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing. : 48594.25103716204
—You just took the words out of my mouth , he said . : 28006.970349311425
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely... : 23759.1425297576
All those wretched quarrels , in his humble opinion , stirring up bad blood , from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind , erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag , were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything , greed and jealousy , people never knowing when to stop. : 12170.9954607717
—They accuse , remarked he audibly . : 26974.43105546525
He turned away from the others , who probably… and spoke nearer to , so as the others… in case they… : 12962.786273367386
—Jews , he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear , are accused of ruining . : 12729.923334813437
Not a vestige of truth in it , I can safely say . : 80384.72486566567
History , would you be surprised to learn , proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell , an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for , imported them . : 12337.068886793784
Why ? : 1850884.7781121505

That’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man . : 13625.443472396673
At least that’s my idea for what it’s worth . : 21658.273091353458

Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee , listening to this synopsis of things in general , Stephen stared at nothing in particular. He could hear , of course , all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to . : 11770.176577586763
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said , if you work. : 15175.225788830847
—Count me out , he managed to remark , meaning work. : 16947.707179390185
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he , the person who owned them pro tem . : 16132.954069556528
observed or rather his voice speaking did , all must work , have to , together. : 13157.64876379933
—I mean , of course , the other hastened to affirm , work in the widest possible sense . : 19969.63396908123

You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has . : 22065.128600513704
What ? : 1089125.7589536693
You both belong to Ireland , the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important. : 14807.550398010315
—You suspect , Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh , that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short. : 19492.164011951038
—I would go a step farther , Mr Bloom insinuated. : 26164.28049228245
—But I suspect , Stephen interrupted , that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me. : 19261.32169819851
—What belongs , queried Mr Bloom bending , fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension . : 13156.606747843352
Excuse me . : 391291.61857744085
Unfortunately , I didn’t catch the latter portion . : 20296.273223797718
What was it you... ? : 55086.80674869954
Stephen , patently crosstempered , repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely , adding: : 13604.964854972293
—We can’t change the country . : 67036.22429654359
Let us change the subject. : 71019.16610264684
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom , to change the subject , looked down but in a quandary , as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry . : 12700.614755477123
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part . : 27912.73753581155
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state . : 16407.61555673935
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people . : 12816.253997784723
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris , the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister , failing to throw much light on the subject , however , he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves . : 11508.029705937426
For instance there was the case of O’Callaghan , for one , the halfcrazy faddist , respectably connected though of inadequate means , with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper ( a fact ) . And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends , after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard , so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act , certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly , putting two and two together , six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to , Antonio and so forth , jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne , then heir apparent , the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state , he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature , a thing good Mrs Grundy , as the law stands , was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it . : inf

Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands . : inf

This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.

Since their names were coupled , though , since he was her declared favourite , where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops , the fact , namely , that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel , having gained admittance in the same fashion , a fact the weeklies , addicted to the lubric a little , simply coined shoals of money out of . : inf
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch , with nothing in common between them beyond the name , and then a real man arriving on the scene , strong to the verge of weakness , falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties , the usual sequel , to bask in the loved one’s smiles . : 11172.97380485732
The eternal question of the life connubial , needless to say , cropped up . : 18515.607720078737
Can real love , supposing there happens to be another chap in the case , exist between married folk ? : 19592.061093543587
Poser . : 654070.9864952827
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection , carried away by a wave of folly . : 16414.872264096906
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order , as compared with the other military supernumerary that is ( who was just the usual everyday _farewell , my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons , the 18th hussars to be accurate ) and inflammable doubtless ( the fallen leader , that is , not the other ) in his own peculiar way which she of course , woman , quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole , his erstwhile staunch adherents , and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations , very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose , thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick . : inf
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream . : 13152.195474518407
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times . : 11795.830138032175
Why , as he reflected , Irishtown strand , a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since , as it happened , he went to reside on the north side . : 17020.124268173946
North or south , however , it was just the wellknown case of hot passion , pure and simple , upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so , types that wouldn’t do things by halves , passionate abandon of the south , casting every shred of decency to the winds. : 9523.429666930011
—Just bears out what I was saying , he , with glowing bosom said to Stephen , about blood and the sun . : 16211.275340723663
And , if I don’t greatly mistake she was Spanish too. : 28445.884543465727
—The king of Spain’s daughter , Stephen answered , adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many. : 10125.14219718143
—Was she ? : 391499.13836868654
Bloom ejaculated , surprised though not astonished by any means , I never heard that rumour before . : 21704.445854355006
Possible , especially there , it was as she lived there . : 19935.451062419397
So , Spain. : 477890.73837668245
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_ , which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date , he took out his pocketbook and , turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he. : 10912.285271985043
—Do you consider , by the by , he said , thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table , that a Spanish type ? : 16521.414010685032
Stephen , obviously addressed , looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom , with more than vision of breasts , her full lips parted and some perfect teeth , standing near , ostensibly with gravity , a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_ , a ballad , pretty in its way , which was then all the vogue . : inf
Her ( the lady’s ) eyes , dark , large , looked at Stephen , about to smile about something to be admired , Lafayette of Westmoreland street , Dublin’s premier photographic artist , being responsible for the esthetic execution. : 13897.092235836404
—Mrs Bloom , my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy , Bloom indicated . : 13660.625039203485
Taken a few years since . : 33350.57690261196
In or about ninety six . : 36607.46893172148
Very like her then. : 133005.03643485854
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who , he intimated , was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen . : 11405.52780322351
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup . : 20881.704238013754
She could without difficulty , he said , have posed for the ensemble , not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the . : 16503.09711517721
He dwelt , being a bit of an artist in his spare time , on the female form in general developmentally because , as it so happened , no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues , perfectly developed as works of art , in the National Museum . : 12114.777843759795
Marble could give the original , shoulders , back , all the symmetry , all the rest . : 35445.28500639458
Yes , puritanisme , it does though , Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors ( Bandez ! : 16400.107486608307
) Figne toi trop . : 71026.34885351249
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word. : 15841.767606958603
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself , her stage presence being , frankly , a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to . : 13761.384446488917
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so . : 63157.37150782878
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering , for sunshine after storm . : 15135.5614187387
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion . : 10493.268422304871
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves , none the worse for wear however , and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_. In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled , good as new , much better in fact with the starch out . : 9980.774288593539
Suppose she was gone when he ? : 64152.382486697585
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses ( _sic_ ) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray. : 9642.530021247365
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished , educated , _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain , far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would. Besides he said the picture was handsome which , say what you like , it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter . : 10214.86182129697
And why not ? : 90572.19558569885
An awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business . : 10907.029690846008
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations , when the thing ran its normal course , became in due course intimate . : 11096.821939475585
Then the decree _nisi_ and the King’s proctor tries to show cause why and , he failing to quash it , _nisi_ was made absolute . : 12146.448214188964
But as for that the two misdemeanants , wrapped up as they largely were in one another , could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course . : 10936.644106241161
He , B , enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader’s , who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery , ( leader’s ) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ ( a by no means by the by appropriate appellative ) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals . : inf
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she , however , was the first to perceive . : 11340.933766167072
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach , fortunately not of a grave character . : 11283.276036696227
His hat ( Parnell’s ) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and , as a matter of strict history , Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him ( and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity ) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he , as a matter of fact , having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else , what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_ , saying: _Thank you , sir_ , though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day , history repeating itself with a difference , after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave. : inf
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest , laughing immoderately , pretending to understand everything , the why and the wherefore , and in reality not knowing their own minds , it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones , who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms , drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others . : inf
He personally , being of a sceptical bias , believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady , even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument , when , neglecting her duties , she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent , the upshot being that her affections centred on another , the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men , no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt. : inf
It was a thousand pities a young fellow , blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was , should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime . : 11582.4773409904
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts , not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson ( who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning ) , as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs . : inf
To think of him house and homeless , rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother , was really too bad at his age . : 15037.461361928848
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or , failing that , the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled. : 10189.49017361138
—At what o’clock did you dine ? : 26971.961178500613
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face. : 22068.026552076728
—Some time yesterday , Stephen said. : 33361.46794437712
—Yesterday ! : 654070.9864952827
exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday . : 16949.301615049728
Ah , you mean it’s after twelve ! : 22987.260370073112
—The day before yesterday , Stephen said , improving on himself. : 23360.79076911155
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. Though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling , so to speak , in the one train of thought . : 10788.808453307453
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect ( which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself ) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas . : 10320.467448734937
For instance when the evicted tenants question , then at its first inception , bulked largely in people’s mind though , it goes without saying , not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums , some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water , he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion ( a partiality , however , which , realising his mistake , he was subsequently partially cured of ) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander , which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that he , though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals , be it repeated , departed from his customary habit to give him ( metaphorically ) one in the gizzard though , so far as politics themselves were concerned , he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows , chiefly , destruction of the fittest , in a word. : inf
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons , getting on for one , as it was , it was high time to be retiring for the night . : 16690.938331653822
The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue ( somebody having a temper of her own sometimes ) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog ( breed unknown ) with a lame paw ( not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too ) to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered , having been there , so to speak . : inf
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives . : 18794.392661958835
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity , all things considered . : 19895.337494960717
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway . : 14065.586914864427
For one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea , if approached , and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly , supposing he did entertain the proposal , as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe , if found suitable . : 13748.900955442892
At all events he wound up by concluding , eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent , a cup of Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up . : inf
A move had to be made because that merry old soul , the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot , didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come , alternately racking their feelings ( the mermaids’ ) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address , as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew . : inf
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep . : 15145.584406460192
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles . : 19758.449999828674
Your god was a jew . : 51023.703783495155
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo. : 16380.605949716683
—I propose , our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo , as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over . : 12407.952563839452
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity . : 24291.07817988402
You can’t drink that stuff . : 41007.575941374074
Do you like cocoa ? : 113557.03017344179
Wait . : 654070.9864952827
I’ll just pay this lot. : 44926.22294796299
The best plan clearly being to clear out , the remainder being plain sailing , he beckoned , while prudently pocketing the photo , to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to. : 10257.57170501442
—Yes , that’s the best , he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less. : 12756.574725544322
All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his ( B’s ) busy brain , education ( the genuine article ) , literature , journalism , prize titbits , up to date billing , concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres , turning money away , duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things , no necessity , of course , to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it , and a slice of luck . : inf
An opening was all was wanted . : 26966.98329650807
Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well , by the way no harm , to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to. : 13618.228525966622
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy , earl Cadogan , had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in London somewhere . : 11569.387293956168
Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement . : 16952.03899804982
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect . : 13796.680172161006
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why. : 23532.104231921527
—Give us a squint at that literature , grandfather , the ancient mariner put in , manifesting some natural impatience. : 11763.883957134167
—And welcome , answered the elderly party thus addressed. : 20315.756051107935
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears. : 12265.672301464494
—Are you bad in the eyes ? : 67526.90579697695
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried. : 38866.166138263645
—Why , answered the seafarer with the tartan beard , who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way , staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as , I uses goggles reading. Sand in the Red Sea done that . : 10154.793318968566
One time I could read a book in the dark , manner of speaking . : 21813.258609736906
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is She._ : 14252.065599208545
Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what , found drowned or the exploits of King Willow , Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts , during which time ( completely regardless of Ire ) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it , all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions , that is to say , either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark. : inf
To cut a long story short Bloom , grasping the situation , was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost , being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion , taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming , making a grand total of fourpence ( the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers , literally the last of the Mohicans ) , he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures , coffee 2d , confectionery do , and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way , as Wetherup used to remark. : inf
—Come , he counselled to close the _séance_. : 22972.63165055671
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_. Stephen , who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out , paused at the , for a moment , the door. : 11243.85218406128
—One thing I never understood , he said to be original on the spur of the moment . : 23266.56847846137
Why they put tables upside down at night , I mean chairs upside down , on the tables in cafés . : 15436.41474709375
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation , saying straight off: : 14921.580931392917
—To sweep the floor in the morning. : 26885.750283861005
So saying he skipped around , nimbly considering , frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right , a habit of his , by the bye , his right side being , in classical idiom , his tender Achilles . : 12816.95247832114
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins. : 11888.36896631104
—It will ( the air ) do you good , Bloom said , meaning also the walk , in a moment . : 22796.04993525073
The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man. Come . : 18004.53265981341
It’s not far . : 70198.21991946433
Lean on me. : 147721.71540071006
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on accordingly. : 23579.788457612867
—Yes , Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him , sinewless and wobbly and all that. : 13036.956871468503
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones , brazier etc . : 16963.873585272384
where the municipal supernumerary , ex Gumley , was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy , as the adage has it , dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new . : 11795.419131272867
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class , probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings. : 13340.41499180532
So they turned on to chatting about music , a form of art for which Bloom , as a pure amateur , possessed the greatest love , as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place . : 13926.081532275353
Wagnerian music , though confessedly grand in its way , was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s _Huguenots_ , Meyerbeer’s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart’s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in , the _Gloria_ in that being , to his mind , the acme of first class music as such , literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat . : 11846.437136361012
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_ , a work simply abounding in immortal numbers , in which his wife , Madam Marion Tweedy , made a hit , a veritable sensation , he might safely say , greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade , in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper Gardiner street , the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos , or _virtuosi_ rather . : inf
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore . : 13771.717898786226
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_ , a gem in its line , he had a _penchant_ , though with only a surface knowledge , for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn . : 13172.68197900109
And talking of that , taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites , he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel’s air in _Martha , M’appari_ , which , curiously enough , he had heard or overheard , to be more accurate , on yesterday , a privilege he keenly appreciated , from the lips of Stephen’s respected father , sung to perfection , a study of the number , in fact , which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen , in reply to a politely put query , said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs , at least of in or about that period , the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist , who _anno ludendo hausi , Doulandus_ , an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch , whom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar , for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd ( William ) who played the virginals , he said , in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull. : inf
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse , dragging a sweeper , paced on the paven ground , brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull . : 12270.925013115244
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk , as it struck him , the two identical names , as a striking coincidence. : 15865.082528615962
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn , which perceiving , Bloom , who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual , plucked the other’s sleeve gently , jocosely remarking: : 13155.883232932765
—Our lives are in peril tonight . : 26971.961178500613
Beware of the steamroller. : 69665.38474336214
They thereupon stopped . : 77669.96587430409
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas , suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new , a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker , a hipshaker , a blackbuttocker , a taildangler , a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch , busy with his thoughts . : 10816.320138208459
But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but , as he wisely reflected , you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up . : 13253.337260585473
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse , without a second care in the world . : 22933.481311892832
But even a dog , he reflected , take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s , of the same size , would be a holy horror to face . : 16040.187676886853
But it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel , ship of the desert , distilling grapes into potheen in his hump . : 12867.499614630644
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained , nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees . : 13241.616843421109
Whale with a harpoon hairpin , alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke , chalk a circle for a rooster , tiger my eagle eye . : 10039.18899551489
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old. : 9778.471068524868
—What’s this I was saying ? : 33329.38650891665
Ah , yes ! : 190271.72864342364
My wife , he intimated , plunging _in medias res_ , would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind. : 16704.435111696774
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen , image of his mother , which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built. : 13340.657533276522
Still , supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected , it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish industries , concert on the preceding Monday , and aristocracy in general. : 10341.006300839323
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck , a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from . : 11497.04641968505
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens , sweet murderers of men , which boggled Bloom a bit: : 12361.800644579063
Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten. : 22999.514245861126
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_. Bloom , nodding , said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did. : 16553.16311130719
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that , the rarest of boons , which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out , could easily , if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain , command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B. A. ( a huge ad in its way ) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success , being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites , if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he , a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties , hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you . : inf
It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season , for choice , causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation , cases of which , as he happened to know , were on record—in fact , without giving the show away , he himself once upon a time , if he cared to , could easily have . : inf
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at , going hand in hand with his tuition fees . : 18666.15959538878
Not , he parenthesised , that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time . : 17615.11149797755
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped . : 9686.6886637829
Besides , though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree , original music like that , different from the conventional rut , would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_. Yes , beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and , booking ahead , give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house , given a backerup , if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs , so to speak , a big _if_ , however , with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows . : inf
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as , being his own master , he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone . : 13430.00192717017
In fact , he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other , possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort , hung on to him at all. : 13700.631079885854
The horse was just then . : 57547.975134213884
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed ( Bloom did ) , without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle , advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who , he noticed , was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present , deprecate him , or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character , no pun intended. : inf
The horse having reached the end of his tether , so to speak , halted and , rearing high a proud feathering tail , added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish , three smoking globes of turds . : 9790.83049695948
Slowly three times , one after another , from a full crupper he mired . : 16194.884967933938
And humanely his driver waited till he ( or she ) had ended , patient in his scythed car. : 12712.82928918921
Side by side Bloom , profiting by the _contretemps_ , with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains , divided by the upright , and , stepping over a strand of mire , went across towards Gardiner street lower , Stephen singing more boldly , but not loudly , the end of the ballad. : 10589.652635164475
Und alle Schiffe brücken. : 70202.74128010684
The driver never said a word , good , bad or indifferent , but merely watched the two figures , as he sat on his lowbacked car , both black , one full , one lean , walk towards the railway bridge , _to be married by Father Maher_. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ ( which , of course , he was utterly out of ) about sirens , enemies of man’s reason , mingled with a number of other topics of the same category , usurpers , historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_. : inf

What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning ? : 20374.277230384858
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square , west: then , at reduced pace , each bearing left , Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then , at reduced pace with interruptions of halt , bearing right , Temple street , north , as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching , disparate , at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George’s church diametrically , the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends. : inf
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary ? : 26165.4912452331
Music , literature , Ireland , Dublin , Paris , friendship , woman , prostitution , diet , the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees , exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets , the Roman catholic church , ecclesiastical celibacy , the Irish nation , jesuit education , careers , the study of medicine , the past day , the maleficent influence of the presabbath , Stephen’s collapse. : 9903.183614281023
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience ? : 14806.675602259515
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions , musical in preference to plastic or pictorial . : 13663.295899963334
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life , a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence . : 14032.504337500452
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious , national , social and ethical doctrines . : 10364.313132524163
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism. : 16963.674768754903
Were their views on some points divergent ? : 33145.402063083864
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus , son of Potitus , son of Odyssus , sent by pope Celestine I in the year <NUM> in the reign of Leary to the year <NUM> or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt ( † <NUM> A.D. ) , suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree . : inf
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength , accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere , Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud ( perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin ) at first no bigger than a woman’s hand. : 8552.916788046681
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative ? : 23473.883056346316
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees. : 17997.07736011719
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past ? : 18550.03042434916
In <NUM> with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue . : 10134.231271341383

What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination ? : 10384.06548271822
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations. : 12246.645822508519
As in what ways ? : 55081.3708767637
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived. : 13058.560073697214
What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination ? : 17258.150510578253
At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers , number <NUM> Eccles street , he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey. : 10346.912301279554
Was it there ? : 848623.907324074
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding. : 23599.23326578436
Why was he doubly irritated ? : 84878.96862848033
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget. : 15322.824854982347
What were then the alternatives before the , premeditatedly ( respectively ) and inadvertently , keyless couple ? : 13092.440882976556
To enter or not to enter . : 32560.096658281996
To knock or not to knock. : 41559.04795727526
Bloom’s decision ? : 147721.71540071006
A stratagem . : 346397.6555345759
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall , he climbed over the area railings , compressed his hat on his head , grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles , lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall. : inf
Did he fall ? : 320927.68668658927
By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure , as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman , pharmaceutical chemist of <NUM> Frederick street , north , on the last feast of the Ascension , to wit , the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era ( jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour , mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo ) , golden number <NUM> , epact <NUM> , solar cycle <NUM> , dominical letters C B , Roman indiction <NUM> , Julian period <NUM> , MCMIV. : inf
Did he rise uninjured by concussion ? : 64287.34671174843
Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact , raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum , gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery , ignited a lucifer match by friction , set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock , lit a high flame which , by regulating , he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle. : inf
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive ? : 20374.01480218459
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of <NUM> CP , a man lighting a candle of <NUM> CP , a man removing in turn each of his two boots , a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle. : 9587.433779345885
Did the man reappear elsewhere ? : 91883.02652150496
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor . : 13700.226790985078
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges . : 22288.435294360657
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat , with his candle. : 18484.37622032215
Did Stephen obey his sign ? : 51089.199782858705
Yes , entering softly , he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom’s house. : 9378.715136943505
What did Bloom do ? : 98862.29085920594
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame , drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone , one for Stephen with its back to the area window , the other for himself when necessary , knelt on one knee , composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M’Donald of <NUM> D’Olier street , kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match , thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air. : inf
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think ? : 55483.88129767504
Of others elsewhere in other times who , kneeling on one knee or on two , had kindled fires for him , of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood , Sallins , in the county of Kildare: of his father , Simon Dedalus , in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin , number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at <NUM> Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara , wife of Richie ( Richard ) Goulding , in the kitchen of their lodgings at <NUM> Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary , wife of Simon Dedalus , in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies , Father Butt , in the physics’ theatre of university College , <NUM> Stephen’s Green , north: of his sister Dilly ( Delia ) in his father’s house in Cabra. : inf
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall ? : 13870.88861531634
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope , stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier , from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction. : 9271.685079385981
What did Bloom see on the range ? : 26095.932201754717
On the right ( smaller ) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left ( larger ) hob a black iron kettle. : 14076.16981106045
What did Bloom do at the range ? : 26102.019795437915
He removed the saucepan to the left hob , rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow. : 11150.780966956947
Did it flow ? : 133026.46100057045
Yes . : 654028.8642034819
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of <NUM> million gallons , percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ <NUM> per linear yard by way of the Dargle , Rathdown , Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the <NUM> acre reservoir at Stillorgan , a distance of <NUM> statute miles , and thence , through a system of relieving tanks , by a gradient of <NUM> feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge , upper Leeson street , though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of <NUM> 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer , Mr Spencer Harty , C. E. , on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption ( envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in <NUM> ) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians , notwithstanding their ration of <NUM> gallons per day per pauper supplied through a <NUM> inch meter , had been convicted of a wastage of <NUM> , <NUM> gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation , Mr Ignatius Rice , solicitor , thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public , selfsupporting taxpayers , solvent , sound. : inf
What in water did Bloom , waterlover , drawer of water , watercarrier , returning to the range , admire ? : 13893.216939704636

What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer ? : 20374.277230384858
That he was hydrophobe , hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water , ( his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year ) , disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal , distrusting aquacities of thought and language. : 12791.324726167419
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing , the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape , stomach and thenar or sole of foot ? : 9364.121926228947

There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural , as distinct from human law , as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence , the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and ( particularly ) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea , in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations , innate lunacy and congenital criminality , decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth , through convulsions of metamorphosis , from infancy through maturity to decay. : inf
Why did he desist from speculation ? : 36304.5668704919
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed. : 12500.19239937334
Did Stephen participate in his dejection ? : 38826.958954602305
He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void. : 10845.62293685629
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom ? : 40958.57099675394
Not verbally . : 346412.9031654586
Substantially. : 56776224.999992244
What comforted his misapprehension ? : 55091.06471939045
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void. : 14534.416489560828
In what order of precedence , with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected ? : 13887.757427802735

What did each do at the door of egress ? : 30977.15543017291
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor . : 22973.306927961647
Stephen put the hat on his head. : 26961.15767341365
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress ? : 21729.619494114548
For a cat. : 346382.7833264696
What spectacle confronted them when they , first the host , then the guest , emerged silently , doubly dark , from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden ? : 10061.393042259746
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit. : 19758.73277713836
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations ? : 15224.890292582058
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation , approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way , discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft <NUM> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius ( alpha in Canis Maior ) <NUM> lightyears ( <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> miles ) distant and in volume <NUM> times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <NUM> of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars , in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years , threescore and ten , of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity. : inf
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast ? : 24647.454207966053
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth , beneath removable stones , in hives and mounds , of microbes , germs , bacteria , bacilli , spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies , themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies , each , in continuity , its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies , dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till , if the progress were carried far enough , nought nowhere was never reached. : inf
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result ? : 23028.366043848848
Because some years previously in <NUM> when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places , e.g . : 10012.209083639846
, the 9th power of the 9th power of <NUM> , that , the result having been obtained , <NUM> closely printed volumes of <NUM> pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units , tens , hundreds , thousands , tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands , millions , tens of millions , hundreds of millions , billions , the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers. : inf
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race , given in species , and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer , easier of solution ? : 11804.734684906745
Of a different order of difficulty . : 44610.19844639802
Conscious that the human organism , normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <NUM> tons , when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity , according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage , impeded respiration and vertigo , when proposing this problem for solution , he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian , Mercurial , Veneral , Jovian , Saturnian , Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions , though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities , to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity. : inf
And the problem of possible redemption ? : 31201.510688684815
The minor was proved by the major. : 25983.74675319466
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered ? : 16914.780810512584
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality ( white , yellow , crimson , vermilion , cinnabar ) : their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo , Simon Marius , Piazzi , Le Verrier , Herschel , Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence ( martyr , <NUM> August ) : the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star ( 1st magnitude ) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day ( a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns ) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star ( 2nd magnitude ) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of ( presumably ) similar origin which had ( effectively or presumably ) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus , and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom , junior , and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses , solar and lunar , from immersion to emersion , abatement of wind , transit of shadow , taciturnity of winged creatures , emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals , persistence of infernal light , obscurity of terrestrial waters , pallor of human beings. : inf
His ( Bloom’s ) logical conclusion , having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error ? : 13524.51145345614
That it was not a heaventree , not a heavengrot , not a heavenbeast , not a heavenman . : 29474.559011181227
That it was a Utopia , there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space , remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence. : 10313.585087704747
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle ? : 20125.52710838956
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet. : 11501.142468995069
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters ? : 21091.52474726041
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams , the sea of rains , the gulf of dews , the ocean of fecundity. : 9743.046910650766
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman ? : 24284.680510656028
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases , rising and setting by her appointed times , waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour , to mortify , to invest with beauty , to render insane , to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light , her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters , her arid seas , her silence: her splendour , when visible: her attraction , when invisible. : inf
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s , who attracted Stephen’s , gaze ? : 16186.938803694466
In the second storey ( rere ) of his ( Bloom’s ) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O’Hara , window blind , curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer , <NUM> Aungier street. : 9623.516673053477
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person , his wife Marion ( Molly ) Bloom , denoted by a visible splendid sign , a lamp ? : 11540.19124999979
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion. : 13134.509384133062
Both then were silent ? : 90879.10446024063
Silent , each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces. : 13136.44910579629
Were they indefinitely inactive ? : 80623.35752273719
At Stephen’s suggestion , at Bloom’s instigation both , first Stephen , then Bloom , in penumbra urinated , their sides contiguous , their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition , their gazes , first Bloom’s , then Stephen’s , elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow. : 9261.180810677635
Similarly ? : 654070.9864952827
The trajectories of their , first sequent , then simultaneous , urinations were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer , less irruent , in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter , who in his ultimate year at High School ( <NUM> ) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution , <NUM> scholars: Stephen’s higher , more sibilant , who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure. : inf
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other ? : 22926.41986605595
To Bloom: the problems of irritability , tumescence , rigidity , reactivity , dimension , sanitariness , pilosity. : 13316.32675554339
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised ( <NUM> January , holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work ) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce , the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church , conserved in Calcata , were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails. : 8971.186818045257
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed ? : 22753.662784842058
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo. : 10768.31226916219
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer ? : 17138.074839618537
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock , obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left , withdrawing a bolt from its staple , pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress. : 9073.626536233687
How did they take leave , one of the other , in separation ? : 31219.475175286974
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base , the lines of their valedictory arms , meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles. : 10676.64508369944
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent , the disunion of their ( respectively ) centrifugal and centripetal hands ? : 12081.780992363712
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George. : 16832.936482131106
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard ? : 17256.85811010177

Alone , what did Bloom hear ? : 44597.24479730891
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth , the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane. : 11148.819986568176
Alone , what did Bloom feel ? : 44597.24479730891
The cold of interstellar space , thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit , Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn. : 10271.306491866946
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him ? : 21347.42827397624

The disparition of three final stars , the diffusion of daybreak , the apparition of a new solar disk. : 11869.779956447948
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena ? : 22253.98483329603
Once , in <NUM> , after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle , Kimmage , he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon , seated on a wall , his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach , the east. : 10673.951158390953
He remembered the initial paraphenomena ? : 37717.93032110977
More active air , a matutinal distant cock , ecclesiastical clocks at various points , avine music , the isolated tread of an early wayfarer , the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body , the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon. : 9413.256640490757
Did he remain ? : 320927.68668658927
With deep inspiration he returned , retraversing the garden , reentering the passage , reclosing the door . : 20858.064086683127
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle , reascended the stairs , reapproached the door of the front room , hallfloor , and reentered. : 16511.4836521203
What suddenly arrested his ingress ? : 39543.234584299615
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where , an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later , a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered. : 10607.494519667456
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture. : 28390.850390790933
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack ( an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute ) : the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard ( a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress ) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table. : inf
Describe them. : 654070.9864952827
One: a squat stuffed easychair , with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere , which , repelled in recoil , had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration . : 9273.074408084847
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves , placed directly opposite the former , its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown , its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush. : 9218.68676843052
What significances attached to these two chairs ? : 40574.60202488076
Significances of similitude , of posture , of symbolism , of circumstantial evidence , of testimonial supermanence. : 12725.042753964344
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard ? : 28946.028899364333
A vertical piano ( Cadby ) with exposed keyboard , its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches , a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes , its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love’s Old Sweet Song_ ( words by G.

With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects ? : 19676.017057521633
With strain , elevating a candlestick: with pain , feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention , focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation , bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement , remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure , repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration. : inf
His next proceeding ? : 90575.11215959559
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone , one inch in height , placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate , placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece , produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus ( illustrated ) entitled Agendath Netaim , unfolded the same , examined it superficially , rolled it into a thin cylinder , ignited it in the candleflame , applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance , placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion. : inf
What followed this operation ? : 55089.64554209223

What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom ? : 16194.391836498624
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl . : 12521.306721964493
Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle. : 10366.70010919549
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention ? : 17227.78691281525

Why solitary ( ipsorelative ) ? : 47189.85385474911
Brothers and sisters had he none. Yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son. : 14254.169935128053
Why mutable ( aliorelative ) ? : 47189.85385474911
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator. : 12720.27897165818
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror ? : 17241.778568687143
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite. : 12940.346967856356

The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition ( parsed as masculine subject , monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object ) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition ( parsed as feminine subject , auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent ) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars. : inf

Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUM> for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die <NUM> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they : inf
theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after <NUM> when I saw the <NUM> Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <NUM> acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUM> years more I have of life up to <NUM> no Im what am I at all Ill be <NUM> in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were : inf

down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of

age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account

is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called

dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <NUM> carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that

that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were <NUM> of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at <NUM> in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those <NUM> lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for <NUM> forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <NUM> consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore : inf
who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> I was married <NUM> Milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at Dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> I suppose hes <NUM> or more Im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though : inf
no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <NUM> or <NUM> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUM> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ <NUM> or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent <NUM> or <NUM> questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at <NUM> 1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <NUM> years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes. : inf
